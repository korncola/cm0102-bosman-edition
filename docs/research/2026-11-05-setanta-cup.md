# The Setanta Cup in the game (0.6.2 item 145)

Date 2026-11-05. The All-Ireland cup (`new_all_ireland`, rules table `wal-nir-irl.tsv`) now plays every real edition from its first, the Setanta Cup of 2005 (row 2004/05). Before, the game first made the cup in 2010/11, because it did not play the group editions (`2026-10-18-cups-more.md`, section 4).

## In the game

| Row | Real edition | Clubs | Groups | Knockout | Group days | Final |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2004/05 | 2005 | 6: top 2 of each league and the FAI Cup and Irish Cup winners | 2 of 3, pots by strength | the 2 winners in the final | 15 March to 16 May 2005 (6 of the 10 real days) | 21 May 2005 |
| 2005/06 | 2006 | 8: top 4 of each league | 2 of 4, two of each league in each | top 2, semi-finals (winner v runner-up of the other group, winner at home) | 20 February to 27 March 2006 | 22 April 2006 |
| 2006/07 | 2007 | 8: top 4 of each league | as 2005/06 | as 2005/06 | 26 February to 16 April 2007 | 12 May 2007 |
| 2007/08 | 2008 | 8: top 4 of each league | as 2005/06 | as 2005/06 | 26 February to 21 April 2008 | 10 May 2008 (Q277) |
| 2008/09 | none | | | | | |
| 2009/10 | 2009-10 | 9: top 4 of each league and the holders | 3 of 3, pots by strength | the 3 winners and the best runner-up, two-legged semi-finals | 29 August to 3 November 2009 | 15 May 2010 |
| 2010/11 on | 2011 on | the knockout of 0.6.0 (slice 21c) | | | | |

How it is built:

- The rows are in `season_cups_more.c`: `new_cups` (the clubs: `picks` per league by last place, `extra` for the cup winners or the holders) and `group_formats` (the groups, the group days, the knockout and the draw day). The group stage is the engine of `season_cup_groups.c`, which the Scottish League Cup, the EFL Trophy and the Turkish Cup already use. The cup is an ItaSuper object (constructor 0x65f670) on the Cup base, so its slots are the ones that engine wraps: slot 10 0x5a8f60 (advance_stage), slot 12 0x519a90 (the honours from the knockout stage), slot 6 0x51fc00 (load), slot 17 0x519890 and map_fixture_tree 0x518790. The constructor (0x65f739) and start_new_season (slot 35 0x858e70, called at 0x65fd7d) ask for the round table with stage -1 and the cup's own +0x3c, so the wrap of create_round_table 0x65f920 (`season_super_cups.c`) calls `season_cup_groups_table` after the new cup's rounds.
- The class's round table stays, but a group season does not play it: Cup::update_for_date 0x51f890 draws no base round once +0xb1 is set (0x51fa01). Its dates are the final, the semi-finals and the group days.
- The clubs are picked when the cup's season is made, at the season change. The game's rows put the League of Ireland season of a calendar year in the row of the season before (row 2003/04 is the 2004 season), so the last places then are those of the 2004 League of Ireland and of the Irish League of 2003/04, as in real life. The cup winners are the last winners of the FAI Cup (key 0x9cf840, "Irish Senior Challenge Cup", the cup of Ireland in key_nation_build_table 0x667150) and of the Irish Cup (0x9cf8c0), read with comp_util_get_latest_placed_club 0x4afd80. The holders are the last winner of the cup's own record. A club with a place already gives its place to the next club of its league (the holders' place: the next club of the League of Ireland).
- 2005/06 to 2007/08 draw each league's clubs in their own pots (`nation_pots`), so each group gets two of each league.
- The group draw waits for the real draw day (`draw`): 13 December 2004 (not found, inference), 12 December 2005, 7 December 2006, 17 January 2008, 28 July 2009.
- The news: "The Setanta Cup is played for the first time." in 2004/05 (it is no longer in item 135's list of competitions played before the table), "not played in 2008" and "played again in 2009".
- Changing rules off: the start season's format every season (open item 131), as before.

Decisions taken by Max's rule "do whatever real life does", with the closest sourced rule where a fact has one source or none:

- The entry rule of 2006 to 2008 is not in two sources. The counts (4 of each league) are; the game takes the top four of each league.
- The 2008 edition and the 2009-10 edition were played late in part (the 2008 group days from September, the final on 1 November 2008; the 2009-10 matches put back to February and March 2010). A late edition plays at its normal time in its season (Q277): the 2008 days after 14 April and its knockout dates are an inference from 2007, and the 2009-10 group days are the six planned days of 2009.
- Withdrawals and expulsions (Shelbourne 2007, Derry City and Cork City 2010) are outcomes, not rules (Q272).
- Extra time and penalties in every knockout tie: stated for 2006 and 2007, not found for the other editions.
- The 2011 rules (the first round of one League of Ireland club against one Irish League club, byes for the two champions and the two cup winners) differ from the knockout of 0.6.0, which gives the byes to the best placed clubs. Not in this item.
