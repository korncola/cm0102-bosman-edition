/* The I liga's promotion play-off waits for the Ekstraklasa's last stage (0.6.2 open item 104).
 *
 * PolFirst (the Ekstraklasa) plays two stages: the groups (its own table, 14 rounds to November) and the spring stage
 * (stage 1, [+0xc][1], 16 clubs). The spring stage marks its places 13 and 14 for the relegation play-off (status +0x37
 * 2 in the stage's table rows, League::update_positions_and_status 0x684cd0). PolSecond (the I liga) plays its own
 * table and then one stage, the play-off of its places 3 and 4 against those two clubs.
 *
 * League::update_for_date 0x6847c0 calls the I liga's advance_stage (vtable +0x28, 0x6849e0) on each day that its own
 * table and built stages are complete (check_complete at 0x684994 and 0x6849be) and a stage is still to come.
 * PolSecond::advance_stage 0x7cc1c0 tests the Ekstraklasa ([0x9cf858]) with check_complete(0, 1) (0x7cc24a..0x7cc253):
 * the first argument 0 skips its stages (League::check_complete 0x689ad0, the stage test 0x689bb2..0x689be8 runs only
 * for 1), so the test passes from November, when the groups end. It then calls update_positions_and_status of the
 * spring stage (vtable +0x94 at 0x7cc270) and makes the play-off (create_play_off_stage 0x7cc290). That function
 * takes the I liga rows with status 1 and the spring stage rows with status 2 into four team slots (0x7cc300..0x7cc375)
 * and gives them to the Cup_Stage (0x522e00). When the spring stage has not ended, only the places already decided
 * carry status 2, so a slot stays 0. Cup::draw_round 0x51c410 then moves the draw one day on each day while a slot of
 * the round is empty (0x51c47c..0x51c549), so the play-off is never drawn, the I liga is never complete, the
 * Ekstraklasa's chain test (Comp::all_stages_complete 0x48ce10) fails on the Polish update day (entry 25, day 170) and
 * both leagues keep their edition for a year (league-stall).
 *
 * In the base data the spring stage ends about a week before the I liga's last round (day 136 against day 143 in
 * 2200), so the test of the groups alone was enough. In the date jump to 2198 (run set pass 2, jump2198, 2199/00) an
 * Ekstraklasa match of the spring stage came after the I liga's last round on day 143: the play-off was made that day
 * while the spring stage's row in place 13 still had status 255 (open) and only the row in place 14 had status 2, so
 * its fourth slot was 0, and its draw moved from day 144 to day 200 and on. Whether a spring match comes late depends
 * on the order of the days' matches: the same leg loaded on day 120 played its spring stage to the end on day 141.
 *
 * So in a season game the I liga's advance_stage waits, one day at a time as update_for_date calls it, until every
 * built stage of the Ekstraklasa is complete and its last stage is built (the test that check_complete(1, ...) makes,
 * read here without its side effects: check_complete sets the complete flag +0xdd and calls vtable +0x94 the first
 * time, 0x689bea..0x689c06). The play-off then takes the final places. Its dates follow from the day it is made when
 * the dates of create_schedule have passed or end on or after the Polish update day (dates_from_today below), and the
 * Polish season change waits for a play-off that still runs on its update day (season_pol_playoff_unfinished). A game
 * where the spring stage ends first is not changed: the test passes on the same day as the original's, and the
 * original's dates (draw about day 144, legs about days 150 and 154) are ahead of that day and before day 170. The
 * base game and RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off keep the original (Q152). */
