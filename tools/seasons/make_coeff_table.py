"""Makes src/recomp_rt/win/season_coeffs_table.c, the real UEFA season coefficients of the season databases whose
values are missing or one season off (0.6.2 open item 106).

Usage:
    python3 -I tools/seasons/make_coeff_table.py --measure <folder of database folders>
        writes docs/research/2026-11-03-database-coefficients.tsv from the databases and the researched values, and
        prints the season that each of the six coefficient slots of each season database holds
    python3 -I tools/seasons/make_coeff_table.py            writes the C table from the TSV
    python3 -I tools/seasons/make_coeff_table.py --check    exits 1 when the C table is not the one the TSV gives

A nation record (nation.dat, 0x122 bytes) holds six season coefficients, doubles at +0xe0 to +0x108, oldest first.
At a new game in start year S the game expects the seasons (S-6)/(S-5) to (S-1)/S there: the first season ranks
the nations by +0xe0 to +0x100 (UefaSeeding::roll_coefficients 0x903b50 makes no shift in the first season,
0x903b6f), the European Performance Spots of the first season read +0x108 (season_uefa_seeding.c), and each
later season change shifts the six down one place and writes the game's own points to +0x108 (0x903b50). So
+0x108 is the season before the start, which counts in the five-season totals of the next five seasons.

TARGETS names the season databases and extra versions that get the real values and the slot offset that --measure
found in each: 0 when the values sit in the right slots and +0x108 is 0 (the season before the start is missing), -1
when all six are one season old, +1 when they are one season early. Max's decision (3 November 2026, "do whatever
real life does"): these databases take the real UEFA values of the six seasons. The values come from
docs/research/2026-11-03-uefa-association-coefficients.tsv (kassiesa.net country rankings 2000 to 2026, read 3
November 2026; UEFA's own coefficient data agrees from 2006/07 on). --measure checks that most nonzero values of
each database are the real values at the offset of TARGETS, so the table fixes the fault that was measured.

A row is a nation whose six values are not the real ones: its id in the database, its name, the six values the game
must find there (a check that the loaded nation.dat is the known one) and the six real values. Yugoslavia in a
database that also has Serbia (a record of a former nation) keeps its values. Russia takes its real values too: UEFA
kept Russia in its ranking after the suspension of 28 February 2022 (frozen at 4.333 a season from 2022/23), and the
game gives a suspended nation no places (season_uefa_seeding.c). The column db_agree counts the changed seasons
whose real value another season database holds in its right slot. The values are written with repr(), which a C
compiler reads as the same double.
