"""The matches of each team in the OFC Nations Cup's group table after an edition of another size (0.6.2 open item 45,
src/recomp_rt/win/season_intl_ofc.c season_intl_ofc_rules).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/ofc_team_matches_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--keep <folder>]

League +0xa7 holds the matches of each team of a League table. The League constructor sets it to -1 (0x682263), and
the table code works it out once from the rows and the meetings, (rows - 1) x meetings (0x684817..0x684830,
0x6827ef..0x68280f). Nothing else sets it, so an OFC object that goes from an edition of 8 (groups of 4: 3 matches)
to one of 6 (groups of 3: 2 matches) kept the 3 of the edition before.

One new game, Tier A, England's leagues (the national sides of every nation play), seed 1, changing rules on: the
3.9.68 database, a 2001/02 start, 1100 days, past the 2002 edition (8 teams, November 2002 in a 2001 game) and the 2004
edition (6 teams, from 29 May 2004). With RECOMP_SEASON_INTL_LOG=1 the class logs at each edition's end its group A
rows, meetings and +0xa7 (season_intl_ofc_honours).

The checks: the program ends with code 0 and shows no message box; the log names the editions 2002 and 2004; in each,
+0xa7 is (rows - 1) x meetings.
