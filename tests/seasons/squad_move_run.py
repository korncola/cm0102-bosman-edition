"""A player moved twice to the linked side holds one squad slot there (open item 187, original-faults group
squad_moves, tools/recomp/original_faults.py at 0x4cc03d).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/squad_move_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--keep <folder>] [--keep-faults]

The run is the start-only run of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py (a new 2001 game, the report of the first day,
then the program ends) with RECOMP_SQUAD_MOVE_TEST=1. At that report the runtime (rt_squad_move_test,
src/recomp_rt/win/original_faults.c) takes the first senior club with a linked B side that does not link back to it (as
Hertha BSC Amateure in item 187, so the placement of a player at the B side comes from bit 0x40 of his contract) and
a player of the senior club with one contract and the placement 4 (at the senior club of a linked side, get_squad_placement 0x4cbb60), calls
CONTRACT_MANAGER::move_to_reserves 0x4cc0f0 twice, as the squad assessment does, and prints the placement before and
after the first move and how many squad slots of each side hold him.

The checks: the run ends with code 0; the test line is there; the placement after the first move is 3 (on the B side);
the B side holds the player in one slot and the senior club in none. --keep-faults runs with
RECOMP_ORIGINAL_FAULTS=keep:squad_moves: it passes only when the line shows the fault (placement 4 after the move and
two slots on the B side).
