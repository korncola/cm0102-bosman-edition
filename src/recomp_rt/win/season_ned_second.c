/* Netherlands: a Jong side never goes up from the Eerste Divisie (open item 114, 0.7.0).
 *
 * The real rule. From 2013/14 the second teams of Eredivisie clubs (Jong Ajax, Jong PSV and others) play in the Eerste
 * Divisie. A Jong side may finish first but never goes up: the highest first teams of the table take the direct
 * places (Jong Ajax won the 2017/18 Eerste Divisie and Fortuna Sittard, second, went up). A Jong side takes no part
 * in the promotion play-off. When it wins a period title, the place goes to the best placed team of that period table
 * with no period title (Reglement periodekampioenschappen eerste divisie 2019/'20, Art. 6 (2)), and from 2021/22 the
 * play-off is filled by the highest first teams of the table with no period title (Reglement play-off 2021/'22).
 * Only the second team of an Eredivisie club may play in the Eerste Divisie, and a club has one team per competition
 * (Promotie- en degradatieregeling 2025/'26, Titel I (b) and (e)). When the first team goes down from the Eredivisie,
 * its Jong side goes down from the Eerste Divisie at once (2025/'26 Art. 10), and the highest Jong side of the
 * Tweede Divisie takes the place (Dutch Wikipedia, from 2020/21). Sources (each read on 3 November 2026; the
 * research is run-logs/0.6.2-s111b/research/NED.md): the KNVB texts named above, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
 * Eerste_Divisie and https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eerste_divisie_(voetbal_Nederland). Before 2013/14 no reserve
 * side played in the two Dutch divisions that the game plays, so the bar holds in every season. The texts of
 * 2013/14 to 2018/19 were not read (every source gives the same bar from 2013/14). Who takes the place of a Jong side
 * that goes down with its first team before 2020/21: no source (no such case in real life).
 *
 * The original. HolPrm::start_new_season 0x5f8610 calls the chain (vtable +0xb0, 0x689c20, at 0x5f8623), which moves
 * the rows of status 0 or 5 of the Eerste Divisie up (league_promote_and_relegate 0x689c80 at 0x689c60). Each period
 * of the Eerste Divisie is a league of its own (HolFirst +0xc, one per period): HolFirst::update_positions_and_status
 * 0x5f6d20 calls 0x684cd0 (0x5f6d29), takes the row of status 1 of the period's table as its winner (0x5f6d9f), and
 * gives that club status 1 in the main table unless it holds 0 or 5 (0x5f6ddb..0x5f6e09); the club then gets 0xfe in
 * the tables of the later periods (0x5f6e78). HolFirst::create_play_off_groups 0x5f6720 counts the rows of status 1
 * (0x5f675f..0x5f6774) and tops up to six with the rows of status 0xff in table order (0x5f677e..0x5f67cd). No step
 * has a reserve check: club_get_linked_b_team 0x540a50 links no Dutch club (the nation test 0x540af8..0x540b10). No
 * club moves into the Eerste Divisie from below (HolFirst::set_up_rules 0x5f6340 gives it no relegation places), and
 * nothing moves a Jong side down when its first team comes down.
 *
 * The fix (season games only):
 * - Before each 0x684cd0 of the Eerste Divisie and of its period leagues, a Jong row gets the original's mark 0xfc
 *   (st_mark, season_second_teams.c: 0x684cd0 gives a row of 0xfc neither the title, promotion nor the play-off).
 *   So the next first teams take the direct places, the next club of a period table wins the period, and the play-off
 *   top-up 0x5f6720 passes over the Jong rows (it takes rows of 0xff only, 0x5f6791).
 * - A table that a save of an older build left with a Jong side on an up status hands its places on (st_shift_up)
 *   before the play-off 0x5f6720 and before the chain. When the save comes after the play-off (HolFirst 0x5f6ee0 gives
 *   the winners 0, 0x5f707e, and the other rows 0xfe, 0x5f709d and 0x5f70b8), the play-off stays as it was played:
 *   the Jong side's direct place goes to the best placed club that is not already up (after_playoff).
 * - At the season change, before the chain: a Jong side in the Eredivisie (an older build let it go up) gets status 3
 *   in exchange for the best placed club of status 3, which stays up (the chain moves the rows in pairs). With more
 *   Jong sides than such clubs, the rest stay one more season (logged).
 * - After the chain: a Jong side in the Eerste Divisie whose first team is not in the Eredivisie (Art. 10 and Titel I
 *   (b)) goes to A Lower Division [0x9cf764], the division of the Dutch reserve sides in the data (League::
 *   relegate_club_to_division 0x6831a0). Its place goes to the Dutch reserve side of the highest reputation outside
 *   the two divisions whose first team plays in the Eredivisie (the game has no Tweede Divisie table, so it takes no
 *   place in a table); with none, to the Dutch first team of the highest reputation outside the two divisions, so
 *   the Eerste Divisie keeps its size (League::move_club_to_division 0x6830b0). A Jong side whose first team the
 *   name link does not find stays (logged).
 * - The club moves of a new game (season_clubs.c, through season_second_barred) fill no place of the Eredivisie or
 *   the Eerste Divisie with a Jong side. A Jong side that a season's club list names keeps its place (the lists
 *   hold the real clubs; fill groups and database places come after the lists).
 *
 * The link. No field of the club record names its first team, so the name links them: "Jong X", "X Jong Y" (the word
 * Jong left out) or "X U21" (and the other reserve last words of season_clubs_reserve_name) is the side of the Dutch
 * first team X. Exceptions, read in the Dutch clubs of the 18 databases of the research (run-logs/0.6.2-s111b/
 * research/db): "Willem II" and "Willem II Tilburg" are first teams; AZ's
 * first team is "AZ" ("AZ Alkmaar U21", "Jong AZ Alkmaar"); "FC Jong Twente" is the side of "FC Twente Enschede" in
 * March 2018. No fuzzy matching.
 *
 * Known effects, accepted: a Jong side that finishes first stays the champion in the competition history, as in real
 * life (League::record_season_honours 0x684640 takes table row 0, 0x68464b..0x68465b), but the title news goes to the
 * next club (0x684cd0 sends it with status 5, 0x685149..0x68529d). The cap of four Jong sides (Titel I (f)) is not checked: no
 * step here adds one more.
 *
 * Switches. RECOMP_NED_SECOND=off (test switch): the original. RECOMP_NED_SECOND_LOG=1: the marks, the places handed
 * on, the clubs that go up and down at the season change, and a count of the Jong sides before and after it.
 * RECOMP_TEST_NED_SECOND_TOP=1 (tests only): before each 0x684cd0 of the Eerste Divisie or a period league, each Jong
 * row gets 30 points more than the best other row (row +0x19, the column of comparator 0x683466), so it would win the
 * league and every period. RECOMP_TEST_NED_SECOND_DROP=1 (tests only): before each 0x684cd0 of the Eredivisie, each
 * first team of a Jong side of the Eerste Divisie gets 30 points fewer than the lowest other row, so it goes down.
 * The two test switches also act with RECOMP_NED_SECOND=off. RECOMP_TEST_NED_SECOND_OLD=<n> (tests only) plays as the
 * original until n Dutch season changes are done, as a game of an older build. RECOMP_TEST_NED_SECOND_LATE=1 (tests
 * only) gives no marks until the first Dutch season change, as a save of an older build made after the play-off. */
