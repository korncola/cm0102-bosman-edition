/* Test switch RECOMP_TEST_NATION_JOB=<nation> (Q15, run set row a2001nation): the human manager also manages a
 * national team, so that a long test game runs the original's national team code with a human manager. Only the
 * test runs set it. A normal game never reads more than the variable.
 *
 * Why a switch. The original has no short path that a script can take: the Apply for Job button of a national
 * team's screen (add_club_screen_action_button 0x482a40) shows only when the team has no manager
 * (club_get_manager 0x53ca90) and its nation's value +0x88 is over 150 (0x544820), no nation is known to be without a
 * manager at a 2001 start, a vacancy decides 5 to 14 days later (MANAGER_MANAGER::add_job_vacancy 0x69ba50), and
 * MANAGER_MANAGER::daily_update 0x68f9c0 offers the job to a human only after 90 days in his club job.
 *
 * What it does. At the first human turn (human_turn 0x5cde40, testrun.c) on holiday, it takes the first human
 * manager (the last 16 rows of the staff table [0xae23bc], 0x6e bytes a row, in use when +0x5f is not 0; his
 * holiday flag is +0x9a01 of his record in [[0xb63c98]], 0xa6ef bytes a record, holiday_next.c) and a senior national
 * team: a club whose id is from [0xae235c] - 2 * [0xae2350] up to [0xae235c] - [0xae2350] (club_is_national_team
 * 0x53b900, 0x544820), with no manager at +0xcf and a nation (+0x53) whose value +0x88 is over 150, the conditions
 * of the Apply for Job button. The named nation (the club's long name at +4) if it qualifies, else the first such
 * team in club order. Then it calls MANAGER_MANAGER::appoint_manager_to_club 0x69ebc0, thiscall on [0xb67a44]
 * (club, staff), the call that ends an application. For a national team it sets the staff's national team +0x24 and
 * job +0x28 (5) and the club's manager +0xcf, and leaves the club job +0x39 as it is (0x69ebc0, the branch of
 * 0x53b900 != 0). A human who manages a national team already is left as he is (a loaded game).
 * It waits for the holiday because a national team adds an item to the left bar menu: the test script's click on
 * Go on Holiday would hit the item below it (Holiday until next match, holiday_next.c), and that holiday ends
 * before the club's next match, where the script has no clicks.
 *
 * The check. At the appointment it finds the team's next match in that year with the fixture search 0x5acbe0,
 * thiscall on the fixture store [0xae2a58] (day, year, end day, end year, club id, list, -1, -2, -1), which for a
 * national team reads the competition types 0 and 1 and takes the fixtures with the club at home +0xc or away +0x10.
 * A fixture (0x4f bytes) has its year at +0x28, its day at +0x2a and its result at +0x43, -1 when not played
 * (docs/research/2026-10-15-holiday-next-match-inventory.md). The log says whether that day is a FIFA day
 * (season_fifa_year_days). At the first human turn after that day it logs whether the human still manages the team
 * and managed it at every human turn between (the fixture has no manager field), and whether the match was played.
 * tests/seasons/future/run_set.py reads the lines. */
