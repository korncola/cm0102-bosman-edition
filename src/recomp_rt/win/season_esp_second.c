/* Spain and Portugal: B and C sides newer than the key pairs of 0x540a50 (open items 121 and 122, 0.7.0).
 *
 * The real rule. Spain (RFEF Reglamento General art. 41, Circular 34 of 2025/26; Bases de Primera y Segunda División
 * 2025/26 art. 9 and 16; Bases de Primera Federación 2021/22, 2023/24 and 2025/26, all read on 3 November 2026): a
 * B or C side never plays in the division of a team above it in its club (its "cadena"), it does not go up into
 * that division and the next club takes the place, and when the first team comes down into the B side's division
 * the B side goes down one division. Before 2021 only one secondary source was found (it says the same). Portugal
 * (press and Wikipedia only, the league texts were not read): from 2012/13 a B side may play the Segunda Liga but
 * never goes up into the Primeira Liga (Porto B, champion 2015/16, stayed down and the next clubs went up), and it
 * goes down when its first team comes down into its division. Sources and the seasons with no text:
 * run-logs/0.6.2-s111b/research/ESP.md and POR.md.
 *
 * The original. Every reserve check of the Spanish and Portuguese league code goes through club_get_linked_b_team
 * 0x540a50, cdecl (club, int *out, need_league). It returns 0 for a club of a nation other than Spain [0x9cf488],
 * Germany [0x9cf314] or Portugal [0x9cf434] (0x540af6..0x540b12), and with need_league 1 for a club whose +0x244 is
 * 0 (0x540ad8..0x540af5; +0x244 is 1 for a club with a pair, set at the start of a game by 0x541e60 at 0x541ea2).
 * Then it compares the club id with 83 senior key ids (0x540b1b..0x54129c, each a jump to 0x541871, which writes
 * *out = 1 at 0x54187c and returns the club of the paired B key) and 82 B side key ids (jumps to 0x54129c, which
 * returns the paired senior club and leaves *out as it was). With no match it returns 0 (0x541868). The key ids
 * come from exact names of 2001 (src/cm3/key_ids_table.c). So *out tells the role: 1 when the club returned is the
 * reserve side of the club asked. There is no C side and no Villarreal, Getafe, Granada, Almería, Zaragoza or
 * Oviedo B side, and no Portuguese B side but Benfica, Braga, Marítimo, Porto and Sporting B.
 *
 * Its callers in the league code:
 * - SpaFirst::resolve_b_team_clashes 0x850970 and PorPrm::apply_b_team_promotion_limits 0x7d0320 (start_new_season
 *   0x84feb0 at 0x84fed1 and 0x7cf9e0 at 0x7cfa01, when the third tier is loaded, before the chain at +0xb0). Each
 *   asks for the reserve side of a club (it reads the result only when *out is 1: 0x850a1b, 0x850c8f, 0x7d03c3,
 *   0x7d0618). First the clubs of the top division (0x850a09, 0x7d03b1): a reserve side in the second division
 *   whose first team goes down (row status 3) gets 0xfb and goes down, and a row of status 3 of the second
 *   division gets 0xfe and stays (0x850ab6, 0x850e99..0x850ebf); a reserve side in the second division whose first
 *   team stays gets 0xfe, and when it held a promotion place (status 0) the first row of 0xff takes it
 *   (0x850c2a, 0x850e61..0x850e93); a reserve side in a group of the third tier is held the same way when its first
 *   team goes down (0x850b28, 0x850c2a). Then the clubs of the second division (0x850c7d, 0x7d0606): a reserve side
 *   in the third tier goes down (status 3, 0x850dd1) when the club goes down, else it is held (0xfe, 0x850e36).
 * - The callers that ask for the senior side of a club and read the result only when *out is 0: SpaSecond::
 *   create_table 0x855b40 (0x855c17: the row of a B side whose senior plays La Liga gets 0xfc, 0x855c55, so it
 *   gets no promotion place in the season, League::update_positions_and_status 0x684cd0 at 0x684dea..0x684e53),
 *   PorSecond::create_table 0x7d1520 (0x7d15f7, 0xfc at 0x7d1635), the exchanges with no third tier
 *   SpaFirst 0x8500c0 (0x8500fe, 0x8501de, 0x85029e) and PorPrm 0x7cfd30 (0x7cfe5c), and the pool of the
 *   Spanish third tier spa_first_exchange_second_division_b_clubs 0x850300 (0x8504c9: a B side whose senior plays
 *   in the tier stays out, 0x8504db..0x8504ec). The season code asks the same through the runtime
 *   (season_playoffs.c barred, season_divisions.c group_pool_club, return address RT_RETURN_ADDR).
 * So the original holds the whole rule; it only lacks the pairs of the newer sides.
 *
 * The fix (season games only, season_game_changes). The wrap of 0x540a50 adds a link by name when the original
 * finds none, for a Spanish or Portuguese club, and only for the calls of the league code above (by their return
 * addresses). The other callers of 0x540a50 (about 120: youth, staff, finance, the squad trim 0x541e60 that sets
 * +0x244) see the original. need_league is not read for the new links (no new side has +0x244 set; setting it
 * would let 0x541e60 trim squads). The link: a B side "<name> B" belongs to the club named "<name>"; a C side
 * "<name> C" to "<name> B", or to "<name>" when the club has no B side. The names are compared whole, without case,
 * within the nation (the data has no field that names a reserve side's club). Over the databases of the research
 * (run-logs/0.6.2-s111b/research/db) every Spanish or Portuguese B or C side in a played division gives its first
 * team's exact name this way, except "Deportivo Alavés B" (club "C.D. Alavés"), which the key pairs hold.
 * - A call that asks for the senior side (the role *out 0) gets the club above: the B side's first team, the C
 *   side's B side. *out is written 0.
 * - A call of 0x850970 or 0x7d0320 (the role *out 1) gets the club below: a first team's B side (or its C side
 *   with no B side), a B side's C side. *out is written 1. A B side of the key pairs with a C side gets its C side
 *   there too (the original gives the B side's senior, which those calls skip).
 * So a newer side gets the 0xfc mark of the season, is held from promotion and from the play-off, and goes down
 * with its first team; a C side the same against its B side.
 *
 * Portugal's pool. por_prm_exchange_second_b_with_lower 0x7cff70 (the form with the database's zones, before
 * 2021/22) moves the Portuguese clubs of the Third Division [0x9cf620] and A Lower Division [0x9cf764]
 * (0x7d0022..0x7d0065) into the Second Division B by reputation with no pair test (no call of 0x540a50 in it).
 * Around that call (season_divisions.c group_refill) a B or C side whose club above plays the Second Division B or
 * lower has no division, so it is no part of the pool, as the Spanish pool rule 0x8504c9; then it gets its division
 * back. From 2021/22 group_pool_club holds the same test.
 *
 * Old saves (Max, 3 November 2026: a second team already above its allowed level moves down at the next season
 * change, as Norway). A game of 0.7.0 or earlier can hold a newer B side in its first team's division, or above it.
 * At the season change, around 0x850970 and 0x7d0320:
 * - before: a reserve side of the second division whose club above plays the top or the second division and that
 *   holds the title, promotion or the play-off (a save made after the table was complete, with no 0xfc) gets 0xfc
 *   and the best placed row of 0xff takes its place;
 * - after: a reserve side that shares a division with a club above it, or plays above it, goes down one division:
 *   in the top division status 3, and the best placed club of status 3 stays up (0xff), so the chain (pairwise)
 *   keeps the sizes; in the second division status 3 (the original's 0xfb, which it turns into 3 at its end), and
 *   the best placed row of status 3 gets 0xfe, as the original (0x850ab6, 0x850ebc); in a group of the third tier
 *   status 3 (the original's 0x850dd1; the refill fills the group). A place of promotion that it held goes to the
 *   first row of 0xff, as 0x850e8e.
 * A reserve side two divisions too high goes down one division at each season change. The tiers below the third
 * are not checked.
 *
 * Club moves of a new game (season_clubs.c): a B or C side does not take a place in the division where a club
 * above it plays (season_esp_barred).
 *
 * Switches: RECOMP_ESP_SECOND=off (test switch) gives the original everywhere. RECOMP_ESP_SECOND_LOG=1 logs each new
 * link, each move, and a census of the reserve sides at each season change. RECOMP_TEST_ESP_SECOND_PUT="<club>:<row>
 * [,...]" (tests only) swaps the club of each name with the club of that row (1 = top) of its own table at the first
 * Spanish or Portuguese season change, before the original reads the table: the statuses stay with the rows.
 * RECOMP_TEST_ESP_SECOND_OLD=<n> (tests only) plays as the original until n season changes of each nation are done,
 * as a game of an older build. */
