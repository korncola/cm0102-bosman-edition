"""A round set up before it was drawn (0.6.2 open item 88, src/recomp_rt/win/season_cup_round_setup.c).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/cup_round_setup_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--keep <folder>]

The run loads a save of 10 January 2008 (a base game: 2001 start, changing rules off, base data, all nations, seed 2,
played in Tier A to that day) and plays 30 days in Tier A. In that game a group match of the 2008 Oceania Champions
Cup moves from 12 to 19 January, so the semi-final stage is made on 19 January, after its own days. The same day the
third-place round is drawn and set up, and the set-up of the final, which was not drawn yet, is passed over: the final
never comes, the cup never ends and no later edition starts. The save: RECOMP_ROUND_SETUP_SAVE, else
test-fixtures/ofc-final-2008.sav; with neither the run fails.

The checks: the program ends with code 0 and shows no message box of the game; the log says that the final was drawn
before its set-up; the new save holds the 2008 row of the Oceania Champions Cup (competition 109) with a winner, a
runner-up and a third.
