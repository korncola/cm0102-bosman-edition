/* ---- New cups ----
 * The formats (rules table rows, columns format and notes; dates marked "inference" are not in the row):
 * - Turkish Super Cup (rus-tur.tsv): one match at a neutral venue from 2006/07, cancelled in 2011/12; the game plays it
 *   in early August (inference: the real dates are late July to mid August). Four clubs from 2025/26
 *   (season_super_four).
 * - Russian Super Cup (rus-tur.tsv): one match, the league champions v the cup winners. Editions 2003 to 2011 in March
 *   before the season (the row of the season before), from 2012 in July (its own row); days 8 March and 14 July are an
 *   inference.
 * - Norwegian Super Cup (nor-fin.tsv): one match in March before the season, editions 2009, 2010, 2017 and 2018 (the
 *   row of the season before); 15 March is an inference.
 * - Russian Premier League Cup (rus-tur.tsv): 2003 only, the 16 Premier League clubs, every round over two legs,
 *   played on national-team dates (the dates of the Euro 2004 qualifiers of 2003 are an inference).
 * - Conference League Cup (eng.tsv): 2004/05, 2007/08 and 2008/09, a knockout of the Conference clubs with extra time
 *   and penalties (the game holds one Conference division; the months are an inference). From 2024/25 the National
 *   League Cup has 16 Premier League 2 under-21 sides, which the game does not hold (Q336): not played. A game with
 *   changing rules off plays every edition in its start season's format (season_new_cup_played, open item 131).
 * - All-Ireland cup (wal-nir-irl.tsv): 2010/11 to 2012/13 12 clubs (two-legged first round, quarter-finals and
 *   semi-finals, one-match final), 2013/14 8 clubs (4 from each league). Item 145: the group editions of 2004/05
 *   (the Setanta Cup of 2005) to 2007/08 and 2009/10, with the groups in group_formats below; none in 2008/09 (the
 *   2009 draw was put back and made on 28 July 2009 for the edition of 2009/10). Their rows give the clubs (picks,
 *   extra) and the rounds of the class's table, which a group season does not play (Cup::update_for_date 0x51f890
 *   draws no base round once +0xb1 is set, 0x51fa01): the final, the semi-finals and the group days. The clubs, by
 *   the rules of each edition (docs/research/2026-11-05-setanta-cup.md):
 *   - 2005: the top two of each league and the two national cup winners (Shelbourne, Cork City and FAI Cup winners
 *     Longford Town; Linfield, Portadown and Irish Cup winners Glentoran), 3 from each league.
 *   - 2006 to 2008: 4 from each league. The sources name the champions and the FAI Cup holders but no rule for the
 *     other places (a gap): the top four of each league is the closest rule.
 *   - 2009/10: the top four of each league and the holders (Cork City), 9 clubs (one source for the rule). Gaps: the
 *     Irish League sent its 1st, 2nd, 5th and 6th of 2008/09 (Glentoran, Linfield, Coleraine, Cliftonville), for a
 *     reason not found; and the draw of 28 July 2009 took the 2008 League of Ireland table, while the game's draw,

/* ---- Group stages ----
 * The formats (rules table rows; the dates are the real weeks where the row gives them, else an inference):
 * - Scottish League Cup (sco.tsv) from 2016/17: 8 groups of 5 (the game's SPFL clubs not in Europe: the class holds
 *   42 clubs, so the groups are of 5 and 4), single round robin in July, 8 winners and the best runners-up join the
 *   European clubs in a last 16; single matches with extra time and penalties; the semi-finals in October and the
 *   final in late November (the final of 2016/17 was on 27 November). The row's bonus point for a penalty win after a
 *   draw needs a match engine change: a draw stays a draw (docs/research/2026-10-18-cups-more.md, section 4).
 * - EFL Trophy (eng.tsv) from 2016/17: 16 groups of 4 with the academy sides; the game holds no academy sides (Q336),
 *   so the class's own clubs (56 in a game of the October 2016 database) play 16 groups of 4 and 3 (August to
 *   November), the top 2 of each to a last 32; ties settled by penalties after 90 minutes, the final with extra
 *   time and penalties in April at Wembley.
 * - Turkish Cup (rus-tur.tsv): 2005/06 to 2010/11 groups of 5 after 2 rounds and 2014/15 to 2016/17 8 groups of 4
 *   after 3 rounds; the class (TurCup 0x8fc670) holds 64 clubs in 7 rounds (36, 28, 32 and 16 clubs; round 3 on 13
 *   December, round 4 on 17 January), so the groups come after its rounds 1 and 2 (32 clubs: 8 groups of 4, top 2
 *   to a last 16) for 2014/15 to 2016/17, and after its
 *   rounds 1 to 3 (16 clubs: 4 groups of 4, top 2 to the quarter-finals) for 2005/06 to 2010/11 and 2024/25 to
 *   2025/26 (the real groups of 5, 6 or 8 clubs need more clubs than the class holds at that point); 2012/13 and
 *   2013/14 2 groups of 4 after its rounds 1 to 4, top 2 to the semi-finals. Quarter-finals and semi-finals over two
 *   legs where the row says so.
 * - All-Ireland cup (item 145, wal-nir-irl.tsv, docs/research/2026-11-05-setanta-cup.md), home and away groups:
 *   - 2004/05 (Setanta Cup 2005): 2 groups of 3, the winners meet in the final (21 May 2005). Group days 15 and 28
 *     March, 11 and 25 April, 2 and 16 May 2005 (6 of the 10 real dates of the two groups). The draw kept the two
 *     league winners apart (one source): the pots by strength put them in the first pot. Draw date not found: 13
 *     December 2004, as the editions after it (inference).
 *   - 2005/06 to 2007/08: 2 groups of 4, two clubs of each league in each group (all four sources show it, the 2008
 *     rules say so), the top 2 to one-match semi-finals (winner v runner-up of the other group, the winner at home)
 *     with extra time and penalties, then the final. 2006: group days of group A, 20 February to 27 March, semi-finals
 *     10 April, final 22 April, draw 12 December 2005. 2007: 26 February to 16 April (6 of the 7 real days; the
 *     last of group 1 was on 17 April), semi-finals 23 April, final 12 May, draw 7 December 2006. 2008: the draw of
 *     17 January 2008 set three match days to mid-April and three in September, the semi-finals and the final in
 *     October (played 13 and 14 October and 1 November 2008). The game plays one edition a season: the season
 *     change of 2008 starts the cup's next season (with changing rules off a 2007 game plays an edition every
 *     season), so an edition cannot run on to the autumn. A gap: the days after 14 April and the knockout dates
 *     are an inference from 2007 (21 April, 28 April, 10 May).
 *   - 2009/10: 3 groups of 3, the 3 winners and the best runner-up to two-legged semi-finals (first legs 3 April 2010,
 *     14 days), final 15 May 2010. Group days of the draw's schedule (28 July 2009): 29 August, 19 September,
 *     3 October and 9 November 2009, 27 February and 13 March 2010. The pots by strength (the mix was 2+1 and 1+2;
 *     they keep the two champions apart, which the real draw did not: a gap, the draw rule is not found). */
