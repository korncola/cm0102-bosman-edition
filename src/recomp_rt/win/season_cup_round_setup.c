/* A cup round set up before it was drawn (0.6.2 open item 88).
 *
 * A Cup keeps two counters: +0xac the next round to draw (Cup::draw_round 0x51c410 moves it on at 0x51c6b2 for every
 * round but the third place, code 0x8c) and +0xab the next round to set up. Cup::set_up_round 0x51c800, thiscall
 * (round), draws the round of its argument when that round's first tie has state 0 (not drawn; 0x51c859..0x51c86c),
 * then sets up round +0xab (0x51c871): a tie of state 1 gets create_tie_fixtures 0x51cb90 with defer (state 2), a tie of
 * state 2 its fixture (state 3; 0x51c900..0x51c95f), and a tie of state 0 nothing. It then moves +0xab on, but not past
 * a third place (0x51cae0..0x51caf3), and lifts +0xac to it (0x51caf9..0x51cb09).
 *
 * So when the argument is not +0xab, round +0xab is set up whether it was drawn or not. Cup::update_for_date 0x51f890
 * sets up the third place on its own day (the last round, code 0x8c: 0x51f986..0x51f9ef and 0x51fab6..). In a base game
 * (2001, changing rules off, seed 2, Tier A; run-logs/0.6.2-s88) a group match of the 2008 Oceania Champions Cup moved
 * from 12 to 19 January, so the semi-final stage was made on 19 January, the day the final and the third place are
 * drawn. The set-up of the third place (round 2) then set up round +0xab = 1, the final, whose tie was not drawn (state
 * 0): the final got nothing, +0xab passed it, and no later call draws or sets it up. The cup never ended, so the 2010
 * edition never started (call trace: set_up_round(2) with +0xab 1 and the final's tie at state 0).
 *
 * Here, before the original, a round +0xab that is not the argument and whose first tie has state 0 is drawn first, as
 * set_up_round draws its argument. Its ties then go through the set-up as every drawn round's do; a tie with a club
 * still missing gets state 3 and its fixture when the club comes (Cup::process_fixture 0x51a150 at 0x51b67b for the
 * winner's tie, season_cup_third_place.c for the third place). In play where every round is drawn before its set-up,
 * round +0xab has a tie state above 0 and nothing changes. A fault of the original that long games reach: the fix acts
 * in every game, the base game too, and RECOMP_ORIGINAL_FAULTS=keep turns it off (original_faults.c). */
