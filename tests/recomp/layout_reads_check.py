"""Reads of the original that depend on where memory lies are patched (0.6.2 open item 138b).

Usage: layout_reads_check.py --exe <cm0102.exe>

tools/recomp/layout_reads.py gives each such read a defined value. This check finds them in the original and fails
when one is not in its INSNS:
- An address used as a number, in one form: `mov eax, dword ptr [reg + off]`, then within six instructions `cdq`
  and `idiv` or `div` with eax not loaded again, where the same function also loads [reg + off] into a register and
  reads memory through it (so the field holds a pointer). In the 3.9.68 exe this form occurs once: choose_captain
  0x6e19b9 divides the manager's non-player record by 20. Other forms (a hash, a compare, `[reg]` with no offset) are
  not searched.
- The local [esp + 0x70] of game_daily_staff_update 0x5ce2d0: its loop reads it at 0x5ce830 and 0x5ce84f, and no
  instruction from the entry to the first read writes it. The patch at 0x5ce311 must write it.
- MATCH_PLAYER::MATCH_PLAYER 0x6eada0 sets no byte from +0x1d to +0x22, which match_eng_update_post_match_reputations
  0x6d1cc0 reads for an empty bench slot (+0x1f, +0x20, +0x21). The patch at 0x6eada0 must clear the record. The
  ctest layout_reads runs the constructor itself.
- SimulatedStats::play_daily_matches 0x84be20 builds a fixture at [esp + 0x40] (it passes [esp + 0x48] after two
  pushes at 0x84c3df) and no instruction of the function writes its match flags word +0x38, at any push depth from 0
  to 12 bytes. quick_simulate_match reads the word (0x6bfeb1). The patch at 0x84c266 must clear the fixture.
- TRANSFER_MANAGER::add_config_loan 0x8bf400 builds a contract at [esp + 0x28] (0x8bf420, also passed at 0x8bf5af)
  and gives it to sign_loan_contract. Neither the function nor STAFF_CONTRACT::STAFF_CONTRACT 0x85e410 nor
  init_from_current_contract 0x85e590 writes its morale byte +0x3d. The patch at 0x8bf420 must clear the contract.
- NationalTeams::select_squad 0x76c120 sets 26 place masks at [esp + 0x70] for squad size 26 (cmp 0x1a at 0x76c769),
  24 for size 24 (cmp 0x18 at 0x76c859) and 22 for any other size: the branch 0x76c939..0x76c9e6 (with 0x76c860 and
  0x76c865) writes no word from [esp + 0x9c]. The patch at 0x76c939 must set the masks from the 23rd to the 50th
  to 0x240, the mask that each size's last places take (0x76c7d9, 0x76c8c1, 0x76c973).
- SimulatedStats: the push depth at 0x84c266 is 0 (0x84c271 writes the fixture's +0xc at [esp + 0x4c]), and
  VIRTUAL_STAFF::fill_fixture_squads 0x90d2f0, which gets the fixture, writes no +0x38 or +0x39 through a register.
- officials_manager_add_random_officials 0x79c5c0 fills each new record in the loop 0x79c6aa..0x79c772 (esi the record
  + 8, 0x79c6a7) and writes no byte of the id +0..+3 or the birth date's leap year flag +0x10..+0x13 there, and the
  sort it calls (0x79c78c) breaks ties by the id (0x79d4c2). The patch at 0x79c6aa must clear the record and set the
  id, and the patch at 0x79c76a must set the flag from the year as Date::Date 0x549ef0 does.
- AWOL::miss_training 0x41a360 writes the stack only at 0x41a38a, 0x41a3e6 and 0x41a57b (the record's staff id), adds a
  13-byte record from [esp + 0x18] (0x41a587, 0x41a58b), and Date::Date 0x54a110 and 0x417c10 write 8 bytes from the
  date +4. So nothing writes the flag +0xc. The patch at 0x41a56b must clear it.
- Each patch calls rt_layout_fix with the index of its group in names[] of layout_reads.c.
Each INSNS row must name the instruction that the original has at its address.
Exit code 0 when every case passes.
