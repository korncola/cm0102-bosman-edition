/* The real UEFA season coefficients of some season databases (0.6.2 open item 106).
 *
 * A nation record holds six season coefficients, doubles at +0xe0 to +0x108, oldest first. At a new game in start
 * year S the game expects the seasons (S-6)/(S-5) to (S-1)/S there: the first season ranks the nations by +0xe0 to
 * +0x100 (UefaSeeding::roll_coefficients 0x903b50 makes no shift in the first season, 0x903b6f), the European
 * Performance Spots of the first season read +0x108 (season_uefa_seeding.c), and each later season change shifts
 * the six down one place and writes the game's own points to +0x108 (0x903b50). So +0x108, the season before the
 * start, counts in the five-season totals of the next five seasons.
 *
 * Some databases hold 0 at +0x108 (October 2022, October 2023, October 2024, December 2025, May 2026, October 2026
 * and April 2024: the season before the start is missing), and some hold all six one season off (September 2005,
 * September 2008, September 2011 ODB, October 2019, November 2020, Summer 2002 and the extra versions December 2008,
 * March 2009, March 2012 ODB, March 2020, April 2021 and April 2023 one season old; October 2021, Summer 2006, June
 * 2010 and April 2022 one season early). Max, 3 November 2026: these databases take the real values of the six
 * seasons (researched, kassiesa.net and UEFA). At the database load of a new game (season_dates.c, after the shift
 * and the history fill), the game writes the six values of each nation of the table, in every start year (also 2001,
 * where no shift runs). A new shift for another year undoes the write first, as it undoes the history fill. The
 * database files stay unchanged. A loaded save needs nothing: it holds the nation records, and a save of an older
 * build keeps its old values.
 *
 * A row is written only when the record of its nation id holds that id and its six values are those of the known
 * database or already the real ones (a nation.dat that a player changed keeps its own values). Nothing runs with
 * RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off or for a database the table does not name.
 *
 * The table (season_coeffs_table.c) is made by tools/seasons/make_coeff_table.py from
 * docs/research/2026-11-03-database-coefficients.tsv, which the tool measures from the databases and
 * docs/research/2026-11-03-uefa-association-coefficients.tsv. */
