"""Belgium: U23 sides stay below their first team and out of the First Division, with the relegation shields (open
item 115), and from 2015/16 the Second Division's 16th goes down directly (open item 124); season_bel_second.c.

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/bel_second_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--only off,on,parent,old1] [--jobs n]
        [--keep <folder>]

Each run is a season jump of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py with Belgium alone on the October 2024 database
(changing rules off, a season game of 2024/25), from the 2024 start to 1 June 2026, so the game plays the Belgian
season change of summer 2025 (BelFirst::process_promotion_relegation_chain 0x41ee80) and the third tier's
promotion play-offs of May 2025 and May 2026 (BelThird::create_promotion_playoff_stage 0x423880). The test switch
RECOMP_TEST_BEL_POINTS puts the named clubs on top of their table (=+) or at the bottom (=-) by points, so the
original would send the U23 sides up. RECOMP_BEL_SECOND_LOG=1 logs the marks, the moves, the play-off and a
census of the U23 sides at each season change. The runs:
    off     RECOMP_BEL_SECOND=off, the original: a U23 side goes up to the First Division, and the 16th of the
            Second Division plays the play-off (proves that the test sees both faults)
    on      the shipped code: no U23 side goes up to the First Division, KAA Gent B (its first team in the First
            Division) may go up from the Third Division, the 16th goes down directly in both play-offs and a
            third-tier club takes its place, and the shield of 2024/25 keeps KRC Genk B (put at the bottom) up
    parent  as on, and RECOMP_TEST_BEL_DOWN relegates Club Brugge KV and KAA Gent from the First Division in summer
            2025: Club Brugge KV II goes down from the Second Division and KAA Gent B (on top of the Third
            Division) does not go up to its first team's division
    old1    the state of an old save, made in memory (no save is written or loaded): RECOMP_TEST_BEL_SECOND_OLD=1
            plays as the original until the season change of summer 2025 is done, so U23 sides go up into the
            First Division. To 1 June 2027: at the change of summer 2026 every U23 side leaves the First Division
            and the division sizes stay
All runs end with code 0 and show no message box of the game. Division sizes are the same before and after each
season change.
