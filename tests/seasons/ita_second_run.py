"""Italy: a second team never plays in its first team's division or above (open item 117, 0.7.0;
season_ita_second.c).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/ita_second_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--only on,off,old,old3,d2023,d2025]
        [--jobs n] [--keep <folder>]

Each run is a season jump of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py with Italy (and England) on an Update Team
database, so the game plays the Italian season change in the summer (the chain of the Serie C era,
season_divisions_ita.c). RECOMP_ITA_SECOND_LOG=1 logs a line at each change, a census of every second team and its
first team before the change, after the chain and after the regroup, and every move. Test switches:
RECOMP_TEST_ITA_SECOND_TOP=1 puts the first second team of Serie A and of Serie B at the top and that of each Serie C group in the
place that goes up first; RECOMP_TEST_ITA_SECOND_BOTTOM=1 puts it at the bottom of its group;
RECOMP_TEST_ITA_SECOND_DOWN=<clubs> sends those clubs of Serie A or B down; RECOMP_TEST_ITA_SECOND_OLD=<n> plays the
original's moves for the first n changes. The runs:
    on     October 2024, 2024 start, to the end of 2025/26. TOP, and Juventus FC and Atalanta BC go down at the
           change of 2025: Juventus Next Gen and Atalanta U23 may not go up (their first teams now play Serie B) and
           the next club of each group goes up; Milan Futuro goes up to Serie B (AC Milan stays in Serie A)
    off    the same with RECOMP_ITA_SECOND=off: second teams go up into their first team's division (proves that
           the test sees the fault)
    old    an old save, made in memory (no save is written or loaded): TOP, Atalanta BC goes down at each change,
           and the original's moves at the change of 2025, so the second teams reach Serie B (Atalanta U23 with
           Atalanta). At the change of 2026 (rule on) Atalanta goes on down to Serie C: the second team at the top of
           Serie B does not go up, Atalanta U23 goes down to Serie C (a relegated club other than
           Atalanta stays up) and on to the Serie D (both in Serie C), and a club comes back for it in Serie C
    old3   TOP and the original's moves at the changes of 2025 and 2026, so a second team reaches Serie A. At the
           change of 2027 (TOP puts it first in Serie A) it goes down, and the best placed relegated club stays up
    d2023  October 2022, 2022 start, changing rules on (the rules of each season): BOTTOM; Juventus Next Gen goes down at the change of 2023 and, before
           2025/26, plays no Serie D (no division)
    d2025  October 2024, 2024 start, changing rules on: BOTTOM; the second teams go down at the change of 2025 and play the Serie D
           (also true with the rule off: this run guards the season boundary). With changing rules off the rules
           of the start season hold, so a 2024 start keeps the rule of 2024/25
In every run after each change: no second team in its first team's division or above (rule on), no "no club takes
its place", no "no club comes back" and no "league sizes: fault" line. All runs end with code 0 and show no message
box of the game.
