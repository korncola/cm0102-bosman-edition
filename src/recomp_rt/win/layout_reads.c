/* Reads of the original that depend on where memory lies (0.6.2 open item 138b, tools/recomp/layout_reads.py). The
 * fixes act in every game, the base game too. The test switch RECOMP_LAYOUT_FIXES turns them off: "keep" all of
 * them, "keep:" with a list of groups some of them ("keep:captain,daily"). The groups are captain, players,
 * daily, stats, loans, squads, officials and training. The ctests layout_reads, layout_reads_kept (the match player
 * constructor), layout_reads_names (the group names) and layout_reads_check (the original's code at each site) test
 * them. A save is no test of them: the save holds heap
 * addresses, so two layouts give different saves whatever the game decides. */
