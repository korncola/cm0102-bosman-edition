"""Clubs of a nation with no league in the game keep their regulars for a continental match (0.6.2 open item 160,
original-faults group callup_marks, tools/recomp/original_faults.py).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/callup_marks_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> --save <samesave.sav> [--keep <folder>]
        [--keep-faults]

NationalTeams::mark_clubs_with_fixtures 0x7775c0 marks each club with a match within a day of a national match: 1 its
own league, 2 another competition of its nation, 3 a competition with no nation (a continental cup). The squad pick
NationalTeams::select_squad 0x76c120 then leaves out a regular of a marked club (contract +0x3d over -10,
0x76cd44..0x76cd73). The original marks a club of a continental match only when the club's nation has a league in the
game (nation +0x11c, 0x7776fc and 0x777721). So in run set pass 3 (a2001offs1, changing rules off) Bolivia picked 3
players of Club Jorge Wilstermann for a friendly on 5 October 2011, the day of Wilstermann's Merconorte Cup match.

The suggested save: run-logs/runset-pass3/run/a2001offs1/leg000/user/samesave.sav (2 August 2011, Tier A, every
nation, changing rules off). The run loads it with Tier A and plays to about 3 October 2011 with RECOMP_DUTY_LOG=1 and
RECOMP_DUTY_LOG_CLUB=Club Jorge Wilstermann (src/recomp_rt/win/duty_log.c: the club's mark after each call-up check).

The checks: the leg ends with code 0 and no message box; the call-up check for 5 October 2011 (day 277) marks
Wilstermann; the duty-clash check of tests/seasons/future/history_check.py finds no Wilstermann row in the new save.
--keep-faults runs with RECOMP_ORIGINAL_FAULTS=keep:callup_marks: it passes only when the checks find the fault.
