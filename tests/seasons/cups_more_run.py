"""Domestic cups, part 21c (0.6.0): four-club super cups, group stages and new cups.

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/cups_more_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--only <name>,...] [--keep <folder>]
        [--reuse]

Each run is a season jump of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py with the nations of its cups selected. The checks
read the "cupmore" lines of the rules report (src/recomp_rt/win/season_super_cups.c: file, year, clubs, rounds,
stages, groups, knockout, winners) and the log (docs/research/2026-10-18-cups-more.md).

The runs:
    i2023   October 2023, changing rules on, 2023/24 to 2024/25, Italy: the Supercoppa Italiana has four clubs and
            two rounds (semi-finals and final) at the new game and after the season change, and its final has a
            winner in the history
    s2019   start run, October 2019, changing rules off, Select All without France: the Supercopa de Espana has four
            clubs and two rounds at the new game
    g2001   the test seam RECOMP_CUP_GROUPS_TEST=1, 2001/02, changing rules on, England: the League Cup plays 16
            groups and a knockout of 32 clubs in 5 rounds (17 stages) and has a winner
    e2016   October 2016, changing rules off, England: the EFL Trophy plays 16 groups (56 clubs) and a knockout
            of 32 clubs in 5 rounds, and has a winner
    n2008   September 2008, changing rules on, 2008 to 2010, Norway: the Norwegian Super Cup is made, plays its
            editions of March 2009 and March 2010 with two clubs, and the row of 2010/11 holds no edition of March 2011
    c2007   November 2007, changing rules off, England with the Conference: the Conference League Cup is made and
            has a winner
    c2008-off  2008/09 (the original data moved to 2008), changing rules off, England, Tier A (RECOMP_TIER_A=1), to
            the end of 2024/25 (about 7 minutes at load 15): the rules of the start season stay, so the Conference League Cup
            plays every season in the format of 2008/09, also in 2024/25, whose row is the National League Cup that
            the game does not play (open item 131: before, it took that row's rounds of day 0 and stopped at the box
            "Date..cpp 52" on 15 June 2024); it has 5 rounds for 22 clubs in 2024, a winner at the end of 2024 and
            no message box
    t2010   start run, September 2010 ODB, changing rules off, Select All without France (Turkey, Russia and the
            Republic of Ireland are not in the 16 rows that the steps click): the Turkish Cup has 4 groups after 3
            rounds, the Turkish Super Cup is made with two clubs, the Russian one of March 2011 (the edition of
            the row of 2010/11) with two clubs, the All-Ireland cup with 12 clubs
    a2003   item 145: 2003/04 (the original data moved to 2003), changing rules on, Northern Ireland and the
            Republic of Ireland, Tier A (RECOMP_TIER_A=1), to the end of 2010/11 (about 5 minutes): the season change
            to 2004/05 makes the All-Ireland cup (the Setanta Cup), which plays each real edition from its first.
            2004/05: 6 clubs (2 of each league by place and the two
            national cup winners) in 2 groups of 3, the winners in the final. 2005/06 to 2007/08: 4 clubs of each
            league in 2 groups of 4 with two of each league, semi-finals and final. 2008/09: none. 2009/10: 9 clubs
            (4 of each league and the holders) in 3 groups of 3, the winners and the best runner-up in two-legged
            semi-finals, then the final. 2010/11: the knockout of 12 clubs. Each edition has a winner in the history,
            the news says "for the first time" in 2004/05 and "again" in 2009/10, and no error box
    a2009   open item 148: 2009/10 (the original data moved to 2009), changing rules on, Northern Ireland and the
            Republic of Ireland, Tier A, to the end of 2011/12: the knockout editions of 2010/11 and 2011/12 (12
            clubs, 6 of each league) pick their clubs again on the draw day of the first round, so the clubs of each
            league are its places 1 to 6 of the season just ended, the byes go to the first two of each league,
            each first-round tie is one club of each league (the 2011 to 2014 rule); each edition has a winner
    r2002   start run, 2002/03 (the original data), changing rules off, Select All without France: the start hook
            makes the editions that the row of 2002/03 holds, the Russian Premier League Cup of 2003 (first round in
            March 2003) with 16 clubs and the Russian Super Cup of March 2003 with two clubs (log lines)

Read runs (fix of 2026-10-21): RECOMP_CUP_GROUPS_READ=1 reads each cup's round table at each report as the Schedule
tab and scout duty do (Comp::build_match_date_list 0x48d500); the groups and the knockout must stay.
    e2016-read  e2016 with the reads: the EFL Trophy keeps its 16 groups and its knockout of 32 to a winner
    x2016-read  October 2016, changing rules off, Select All without France, the season played to its end (about
                an hour): the Scottish League Cup (8 groups, a knockout of 16), the EFL Trophy and the Turkish Cup
                (8 groups after 2 rounds, a knockout of 16) keep their groups to a winner; no error box

Save and load runs (review 1 of 2026-10-20): the first program plays the season jump and saves the game
RECOMP_SAVE_AFTER_DAYS game days after the start, inside a competition of this part; a second program loads that save
(tests/fixtures/fixtures.py LOAD_STEPS) and plays on with the season jump and the rules report to the end report of
the season. The check reads the loaded program's report and log.
    e2016-load  October 2016, England, changing rules on: saved after 100 days (late October 2016, between the
                second and the third group match day of the EFL Trophy); after the load the knockout of 32 clubs is
                drawn and the Trophy has a winner
    i2023-load  October 2023, Italy, changing rules on: saved after 189 days (20 January 2024, between the
                semi-finals of 18 January and the final of 22 January of the four-club Supercoppa); after the load
                the final is played and the cup has a winner
    n2008-load  September 2008, Norway, changing rules on: saved after 150 days (December 2008, after the module
                made the Norwegian Super Cup of March 2009 on its vtable copy); after the load the cup is played
                and has a winner
    a2004-load-wait  item 145: 2004/05 (the original data moved to 2004), Northern Ireland and the Republic of
                Ireland, changing rules on: saved after 100 days (October 2004, before the draw day of the
                All-Ireland cup, 13 December); after the load the groups and the final are drawn and played
    a2004-load-mid  the same, saved after 262 days (late March 2005, between group match days); after the load the
                groups end, the final is drawn and the cup has a winner
    a2007-load-gap  2007/08 (the original data moved to 2007), the same nations: saved after 400 days (August 2008,
                in 2008/09, which has no edition); after the load the cup comes back in 2009/10 with 9 clubs in 3
                groups and has a winner

A run starts a game only when fewer than 15 games run on this Mac and the load of the last minute is below 24 (Max's
limit), and its game stops when the script stops (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP). Run at most three of these scripts at
a time (--only).
