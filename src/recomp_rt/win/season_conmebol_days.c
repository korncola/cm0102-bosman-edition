/* The match days of the South American section of World Cup qualifying in a season game (open item 163 of 0.6.2).
 *
 * The cause. WcSouthAmericanLeague::create_schedule 0x920590 gives the original's template of the 2002 cycle (18
 * rounds from March 2000 to November 2001, moved to each cycle), and end_by_october (season_intl_qual.c) only moves
 * its end. Each fixture then moves on its own to the nearest free FIFA day of its year (season_friendly_dates.c
 * fifa_target_by). The template puts 10 rounds in the year two years before the finals, from February, and that
 * year's FIFA days within the stage hold 9: in run set game a2002s3 the whole matchday of 1 August 2012 kept its
 * day (Argentina v Paraguay among them), and the Copa Sudamericana of 31 July (item 95 keeps it off the FIFA days
 * only) met it with three of Huracan's players on duty (get_international_duty_club 0x7757d0: the day before to the
 * day after). The 2098 cycle of a2006s3 did the same on 15 August 2096, and 2080 and 2084 kept November days.
 *
 * Real life. The cycles 2006 to 2026 played 18 matchdays in the FIFA windows from September or October three years
 * before the finals to September or October the year before, mostly two a window (en.wikipedia.org, "<year> FIFA
 * World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)", the matchday sections). Not exactly two: 2006 had single matchdays in March
 * and November 2004, 2022 three in September and October 2021, and 2026 left out March and June 2024 for the Copa
 * America. So a section of 18 rounds of those cycles takes the real days (real[] below: the first day of each
 * matchday). The 2022 cycle is the exception: its real days ran to 29 March 2022, and the game ends the section by
 * 10 October 2021 for its tie of November 2021 (season_intl_qual.c real_end), so it takes the window rule below
 * from its real first day, 8 October 2020.
 *
 * The window rule (2022, every cycle after the table, and a section of another round count; an inference from the
 * real cycles): the FIFA days of the span, in each FIFA window (FIFA days at most WINDOW_GAP apart) its first day
 * and the next at least MIN_GAP days later, the windows with two such days first, then the other days (a third day
 * of a window, a window of one day), earliest first; with more two-day windows than the rounds need, windows spread
 * evenly from the first to the last of the span. A day in a South American final's days is left out. When the
 * span holds too few, its first day moves back a week at a time (the list has no FIFA days from March to September
 * 2020). The span after the table: 1 September three years before the finals to 15 October the year before (the
 * real first days were in September or October, the latest real last day 15 October 2013). */
