"""The free places of the access lists in a game with fewer UEFA nations (0.6.2 open item 94).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/uefa_free_places_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--keep <folder>]

The run loads a save of June 2026 (the original data 3.9.68 jumped to 2025/26, England and Spain, changing rules
on, Tier A, seed 1: test-fixtures/uefa-free-places-2026.sav, or RECOMP_FREE_PLACES_SAVE). Leg 1 plays 25 days in
Tier A, past the UEFA places of day 171, and saves. Leg 2 loads that save and plays on past the league phase draws
of the three cups (about 1 September). The original data has 52 UEFA nations and the access list of 2026/27 has 55
ranks, so the first qualifying rounds of the Champions League and the Conference League have free places.

Max, 3 November 2026: do what UEFA does (open item 94d). A vacancy moves up its path, and a gap at the bottom stays
empty: the round has fewer clubs, and no club of another association takes it (UEFA Champions League regulations
2026/27, Art. 3.04 to 3.07 and 4.05). The cup code plays only even rounds, so the best-ranked new club of an odd
round enters one round later (a bye, as the rebalanced access lists do). The checks:
- leg 1: no free place of the Champions League or the Conference League goes to a club, and the log shows the
  places that stay empty for both; each nation has no more Champions League clubs than its places in the list
  plus its title holders and European Performance Spots (the seeding's log, and the clubs with a Champions League
  place in the save); the Champions League clubs of each nation, title holders apart, are the first clubs of its
  top division of the last season, with no club left out (item 94b: on main ec04eb89 Spain had 1 to 4 and 8 to 10);
- leg 2: no box, every qualifying layout is made (no odd round, no short group stage), and the league phases of
  the three cups are drawn with 36 clubs each.
On d3deb121 (item 94c) the free places went to the best-ranked nations: Spain took 3 Champions League places and
ranks 1 to 5 one Conference League place each. A run takes about 5 to 10 minutes.
