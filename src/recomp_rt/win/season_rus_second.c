/* Russia: second teams ("-2" sides) of Russian clubs (open item 120, 0.7.0).
 *
 * The real rule. A second team plays below its club's first team: it never goes up into the Premier League or its
 * play-off (the next club takes the place), it goes up from the third tier only while its first team plays in the
 * Premier League, two teams of one club never play in one division, and a second team goes down when its first team
 * comes down into its division, as one of the clubs that go down. Sources (read 3 November 2026, notes in
 * run-logs/0.6.2-s111c-rus/research.md):
 * - FNL Regulation 2015/16 art. 4.3 and 4.4 (RFS executive decision 166/4 of 24 June 2015), FNL Regulations 2021/22
 *   and 2022/23 art. 3.3, 3.3.1 and 3.4 (1fnl.ru PDFs): a second team of an RPL club in places 1 to 6 gets no right
 *   to go up or to the play-off, the clubs below it get it; when its club comes down into the FNL it goes down
 *   whatever its place and counts among the clubs that go down;
 * - First League Regulation 2024/25 art. 3.3.1 and 3.4: the same. Second League Division A 2023/24 and 2024/25 art.
 *   3.19 and 3.41, 2025/26 and 2026/27 art. 3.12, 3.14 and 3.30: two teams of one club never play in one competition
 *   or go up into a league where another team of the club plays, the second team of a First League club does not go
 *   up while its first team plays there (the next club does), and a second team counts among the clubs that go down
 *   when its first team comes down into its league;
 * - 2023/24, 2025/26 and 2026/27: the First League Regulations have no clause on a second team's promotion to the
 *   Premier League. The bar there is an inference from the Division A rule above (two teams of one club never in one
 *   league). No second team played the First League in those seasons;
 * - 2001 to 2014/15: no regulation text found. Russian Wikipedia (Система футбольных лиг России, uncited) says that
 *   a second team could go up from the PFL to the FNL only while its first team played in the top flight; none
 *   played the FNL before 2015/16 (Spartak-2 went up from PFL West 2014/15). The same rule is used.
 * The zones are not played, so a first team that comes down into its second team's zone changes nothing here.
 *
 * The original. The game plays two Russian divisions: the Premier League (RusPrm, key 0x9cf930) and the First
 * Division (RusFirst, key 0x9cf92c). The six zones of the Second Division (keys 0x9cf914..0x9cf928) only hold clubs.
 * RusPrm::start_new_season 0x7eb800 first calls the promotion chain (vtable +0xb0, League::process_promotion_
 * relegation_chain 0x689c20, at 0x7eb813), which moves the rows of status 0 or 5 of the First Division up and the
 * rows of status 3 of the Premier League down (league_promote_and_relegate 0x689c80). Then it calls
 * rus_prm_exchange_first_and_second_division_clubs 0x7ebe20 (at 0x7eb81b). That function lists every club whose
 * division is one of the six zones (0x7ebf87..0x7ebfa8), returns with no move when the list holds fewer than 3
 * (0x7ebfeb), sorts the list by reputation and shuffles the top 3 (comp_util_sort_and_shuffle_top_clubs 0x4afbd0 at
 * 0x7ec009), moves the first club of zones 1 or 2, of zones 3 or 4 and of zones 5 or 6 into the First Division
 * (League::move_club_to_division 0x6830b0 at 0x7ec0be), and then sends the clubs of the last three rows of the First
 * Division table (0x6826d0: table +0xb1 plus the row times 0x3b, rows +0x3e - 1, - 2 and - 3) to zones 0x9cf918,
 * 0x9cf91c and 0x9cf924 (League::relegate_club_to_division 0x6831a0 at 0x7ec100, 0x7ec11c, 0x7ec138). It reads only
 * the club of each row (+0), so the rows give the order of last season's table; neither move writes the table. No
 * step tests a second team: club_get_linked_b_team 0x540a50 holds pairs of Spain, Germany and Portugal only (the
 * nation test at 0x540af6..0x540b12). So a "-2" side with a high reputation goes up from its zone in every season,
 * wins promotion to the Premier League by table, and can play in its own club's division.
 *
 * The link. No field of the club record names the club of a second team. A Russian club is a second team when its
 * name, in plain words (letters and digits, without the words "FK", "FC" and the like), has a word "2", "II" or "M"
 * ("Zenit 2 St. Petersburg", "Arsenal-2 Tula", "CSKA Moscow II", "Fakel-M Voronezh"; not "Krasnodar-2000"), and a
 * Russian club whose plain name is the same without that word exists (its parent). Two small tables, by exact name:
 * the parent of the names that differ from it ("Torpedo 2 Moskau" for Torpedo Moscow), and first teams whose names
 * have such a word ("Volgar-Gazprom-2 Astrakhan", the club of Astrakhan in 2009 to 2011; "FK Orenburg 2", FK Orenburg
 * itself in the March 2018 database, the club id of "FK Orenburg" of 2023, so "FK Orenburg-2" there links to it;
 * "Saturn-2 Moscow Oblast", an independent club from 2011). A club with no parent in the data is no second team here.
 * Evidence: the names of every test database, run-logs/0.6.2-s111c-rus/namecheck.txt. The links are kept for one game
 * day (a cache by club table, count and date), so the hook before each 0x684cd0 costs no scan of the clubs.
 *
 * The fix, season games only (season_game_changes):
 * - the zone exchange: a second team that may not play in the First Division is no part of the list of 0x7ebe20
 *   (for the call its division reads as none, then it gets its zone back), so the next club of its zones goes up.
 *   It may not when its club plays below the Premier League, or when another second team of its club plays in the
 *   First Division or stands before it in the zones (higher reputation, then the lower club id);
 * - the same call: a second team in the First Division that may not stay there takes, for the call only, the club
 *   of the highest of the last three rows (row +0x3e - 3, then - 2, then - 1) that may stay, so the original sends
 *   it to that row's zone and the club of the row stays up: it counts among the clubs that go down. A second team
 *   beyond the three rows goes down after the call to zone 0x9cf918 (0x6831a0, as 0x7ec100), and the club of the
 *   zones with the highest reputation that may go up and did not just come down takes its place (0x6830b0);
 * - the First Division table: before each League::update_positions_and_status 0x684cd0 of RusFirst every second
 *   team gets the original's mark 0xfc (st_mark, season_second_teams.c), so the next club takes promotion. A save
 *   made after the table was complete: before the chain the places go on to the next clubs (st_shift_up);
 * - the Premier League (a game of an older build): before the chain each second team gets status 3 in exchange for
 *   the best placed club of status 3, which stays up (the chain moves pairs). It comes down into the First Division
 *   and goes on to a zone as above when it may not stay there either;
 * - the club moves of a new game (season_clubs.c) put no second team into the Premier League, nor into the First
 *   Division while its club's division then is not the Premier League.
 *
 * Switches. RECOMP_RUS_SECOND=off (test) gives the original. RECOMP_RUS_SECOND_LOG=1 logs the clubs held, moved and
 * marked, and a census of each division before and after each season change. Tests only: RECOMP_TEST_RUS_SECOND_REP=1
 * gives each second team of the zones that may not go up the reputation 10000 and every other one 9000 before
 * 0x7ebe20, so the original takes them first (=allowed: the other way round); RECOMP_TEST_RUS_SECOND_PTS=1 gives each second team of the First
 * Division and the Premier League 500 more points before a 0x684cd0 while it has fewer than 500, so the original
 * promotes it or gives it the title;
 * RECOMP_TEST_RUS_SECOND_PARENT_DOWN=1 sends the parent of a second team of the First Division down from the Premier
 * League at the next season change (status 3, in exchange for the best placed club of status 3);
 * RECOMP_TEST_RUS_SECOND_OLD=<n> plays as the original until n Russian season changes are done, as a game of an older
 * build; RECOMP_TEST_RUS_SECOND_NO_MARK=1 gives no mark before 0x684cd0, as a save made after the table was complete,
 * so that the season change hands the places on. */
