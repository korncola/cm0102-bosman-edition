"""A weather postponement keeps the match day's place in its fixture list (0.6.2 item 84;
src/recomp_rt/win/match_day_place.c).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/match_day_place_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> --keep <folder> [--save <in.sav>]
        [--days 6] [--keep-fault] [--normal]

The save: --save, else RECOMP_MATCH_DAY_SAVE, else test-fixtures/fin-2046-postpone.sav. It is a save of the Tier A game
a2021s1 of run set pass 1 (October 2021 data, all nations, changing rules on, seed 1), made on holiday in October
2046, before 18 October (day 291). On that day the weather postpones SC Kufu-98 v SJK Seinäjoki of the Veikkausliiga,
the next match of that day's list is HJK Helsinki v JIPPO Joensuu, and without the fix it is never played.

The weather's rolls do not come back the same after a load, so the run names the match to postpone with the test
switch RECOMP_TEST_POSTPONE=7163,7286 (SC Kufu-98 v SJK Seinäjoki). It loads the save in Tier A (RECOMP_TIER_A=1, as
the save was made), plays --days game days on holiday and saves (tests/seasons/soak_run.py load_leg). The checks:
    - HJK Helsinki v JIPPO Joensuu of round 28 of 2046 has a result in the end save
    - no fixture of any competition dated from the first day after the save's day to two days before the end save's
      day is left without a result; a postponed one (result byte -2) is moved, not lost
    - the log has the line "recomp: match day: a weather postponement on day 291 of 2046 moved the place in its fixture
      list, set back"
    - no message box, and the program ends with code 0
--normal plays the normal game (no Tier A switch): the fault is in the original's code, which Tier A does not change.
--keep-fault runs with RECOMP_MATCH_DAY_PLACE=off (the original's place). The first three checks must then fail: this
is the proof that the run finds the fault. (The full replay of the Tier A leg from its 2041 checkpoint, about an hour,
lost the match on a build without the fix too.)

The fixture records of fixtures_<year>.tmp (the save's form of the fixture store): the clubs' ids at +0x1c and +0x20,
the competition word at +0x24, the date (day, year) at +0x38 and +0x3a, the round at +0x44, the home goals at +0x53
(-1 not played, -2 postponed). The game's record is 0x10 bytes shorter at the front (its date at +0x28).
