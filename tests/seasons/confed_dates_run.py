"""The Confederations Cup in June (0.6.2 open items 157 to 159, original-faults group confed,
src/recomp_rt/win/season_intl_rules.c confed_june_shift).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/confed_dates_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--keep <folder>] [--keep-faults]

The original plays the Confederations Cup of every odd year from 29 July to 9 August (0x58b601, 0x58b984), in the days
of its own Club World Championship and the European club qualifiers. In the changing-rules-off games of run set pass 3
clubs of those cups played the day before, of or after a match of a side that held 3 or more of their players
(the duty-clash check of tests/seasons/future/history_check.py). The fix moves each such edition to the Saturday on
or before 18 June, so the whole edition plays in June, as the real editions mostly did.

One new game, Tier A, every nation, seed 1, changing rules off (the base game: the 3.9.68 database, 2001/02). Leg 1
saves on 13 June 2003, after the squad picks of the June edition (from 14 June 2003; a finals squad is picked 10 days
before its first match, NationalTeams::select_squad 0x76c120). Leg 2 loads that save and saves on 25 July 2003, after
the squad picks of the original's July edition.

The checks: each leg ends with code 0 and no message box; every Confederations Cup match of 2003 lies in June (the
fixtures of the second save); the duty-clash check finds no club match within a day of a match of a side that holds 3
or more of its players, in either save. With RECOMP_DUTY_LOG=1 (src/recomp_rt/win/duty_log.c) the script also prints
how many club matches the original's call-up move (0x5abb10) moved and how many stayed.
--keep-faults runs with RECOMP_ORIGINAL_FAULTS=keep:confed (the original's dates). It passes only when the June check
fails and the legs end well: the proof that the check finds the fault.
