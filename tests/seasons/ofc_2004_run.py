"""The OFC Nations Cup of 2004 (0.6.2 open item 136, src/recomp_rt/win/season_intl_ofc.c).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/ofc_2004_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--keep <folder>]

The real final stage of 2004 (rules table rows int-continental-32 and -43; https://www.rsssf.org/tables/04oc.html and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_OFC_Nations_Cup): one group of 6 in Adelaide from 29 May to 6 June 2004, each pair
once, then the top two in a two-legged final, 9 October 2004 in Honiara and 12 October 2004 in Sydney. The original's
class plays two groups of 3 and semi-finals (OceaniaNations, create_group_table 0x7995a0, create_group_stage
0x799a60, create_knockout_stage 0x799c50).

One new game, Tier A, England's leagues (the national sides of every nation play), seed 1, changing rules on: the
3.9.68 database, a 2001/02 start, to 15 August 2004 (in the pause between the group and the final), a save, then the
save loaded and on to 31 December 2008, so the final is made before the save and played after the load, and the class
moves on to the next edition of the table (2008: one group of 4, home and away, ofc_2008_run.py).

The checks: each leg ends with code 0 and shows no message box; the 2004 edition's matches from May to June are one
round robin of 6 teams (15 matches, each pair once) from 29 May to 6 June 2004; its later matches are two, from 9 and
12 October 2004, between two teams of the group, home and away; the history row of 2004 has those two as winner and
runner-up; no match of the class is played from November 2004 to September 2007 (the table holds no edition of
2006); the 2008 edition has 4 teams and 12 matches and a history row. A day may be up to LATE days later than the real one, for a match that a clash moves (add_fixture
0x5aa680), as tests/seasons/ofc_2008_run.py allows.
