/* The Tier A switch (0.6.2 slice 3, decisions Q9, Q10, Q16 and Q31 of the future play spec). RECOMP_TIER_A=1 is a
 * test switch, read once at the start and off by default. Off, every wrap below runs the original at once, so the
 * game is the same (Q152). On, a game plays only the competitions, to reach far years quickly: the calendar, draws,
 * entrants, league tables, season changes, history, finances, retirements, new players, contracts, and save and
 * load stay. The AI transfer market, background matches, new injuries and AI manager moves stop, and each match gets
 * an instant result from the two sides' reputation. Research: run-logs of slice 3 (research-match.md and
 * research-skips.md, read again for each address cited here) and run-logs/future-3/profile.md (the share of a
 * normal year of each area).
 *
 * The skips, each a full no-op that pops the original's arguments (no caller reads eax, cited per wrap). They act
 * only when the game is made (0xdd711c), so a Tier A game is made as the normal game is:
 * - The AI transfer market: update_club_shortlist 0x83a730 (ret 4 at 0x83a772, called at 0x5cdd15),
 *   make_club_bids 0x84a020 (ret 4 at 0x84abbf, called at 0x5cdd6d), the day loop's calls of the position lists
 *   0x839e60 (ret 4 at 0x83a12c, called at 0x5cda46) and 0x83a780 (ret at 0x83a9c4, called at 0x5cda56; the
 *   constructor 0x839cf8, the load 0x83b229 and 0x83a6b3 still build them), and add_player_to_club_shortlists
 *   0x842c00 (ret 8 at 0x842dfe, 17 callers, none reads eax). The day loop's
 *   club loop 0x5cdc4e..0x5cdd9a still runs, so the media calls 0x754a30 and 0x757c70 in it (their only callers)
 *   keep the story log short. The original's flag 0x9cd1f8 would skip them too, so it is not used.
 * - Background matches: SimulatedStats::play_daily_matches 0x84be20 (ret at 0x84c4fb, called at 0x5cdac9). It
 *   writes no fixture, table or history row, only player stats of clubs with no loaded league.
 * - Not original code, for the AI sales that Tier A lacks: a full AI club lets its weakest players over 21 go
 *   (release_surplus, open item 78).
 * - The other way, for the AI signings that Tier A lacks: an AI club with fewer than SIGN_BELOW players in its squad
 *   slots runs its own market, the original's shortlist and bids (short_club, open item 92).
 * Contracts stay. A skip of the contract pass 0x4c7ac0 (contract ends, called at 0x5cd406) and of the daily staff
 * pass 0x5ce2d0 (the AI contract offers, 0x4cda70 at 0x5d19d7 and five more) left each player at his club after his
 * contract ended, and such a player cannot play (an England game from 2025: Aston Villa had 50 players and 4 who
 * could play its Champions League match in August 2028, and init_match 0x6b7f20 stopped at match_eng.cpp 652,
 * 0x6b8aca). The top-up of match squads (0x90d2f0) counts the players at the club, not the ones who can play, so it
 * did not help. With the contract code kept, a player whose contract ends leaves the club, and a club below 15
 * gets virtual players for its matches. The shortlist offers of the daily staff pass (0x5cfaf6, 0x5d585f) are
 * add_player_to_club_shortlists 0x842c00 and stop with the market.
 * - Injuries: Injury::add_injury 0x62d250 (ret 0x20, wrapped in injury_init.c) returns -1 after the game is made.
 *   The injuries of the database and of game creation stay, and heal by date when read (0x62c680 from 0x62c400
 *   and 0x62ed70), with no daily code.
 * - AI manager moves: MANAGER_MANAGER::consider_sacking_manager 0x69aba0 (ret 8 at 0x69acb8, callers 0x696525,
 *   0x696539, 0x6a59b4, 0x6aa0c1, none reads eax), so no sacking or ultimatum. An appointed manager can still
 *   leave his club for a vacancy. The vacancy pass 0x68f9c0 stays: retirements (0x7aaeb0 calls add_job_vacancy 0x69ba50) and the season change
 *   (league_promote_and_relegate 0x689c80) open vacancies, and only it fills them. Without it more clubs and
 *   national teams would have no manager each year, as Q31 found for players.
 *
 * The instant result. match_day_can_quick_simulate 0x6b66a0 (cdecl, ret, callers 0x6b4ae3 and 0x6b5c9a push eax
 * as the quick argument of init_match 0x6b7f20) gives 1, after the original has run for its side effect on the
 * human clubs' flags (0x6b66b1..0x6b66df). Then run_match_steps 0x6b98c0 calls quick_simulate_match 0x6beeb0
 * (thiscall, ret at 0x6c0661, one caller 0x6b98d7, eax not read) for every match. Its wrap writes the score that
 * 0x6beeb0 writes, with the same tie rules, and skips the per-minute play, scorers, cards, injuries and ratings:
 * - the fixture copy F is [engine + 0x4792] (0x6bfe2b); its clubs are F+0x1c and F+0x20 (0x6c021c..0x6c0225),
 *   each with the reputation s16 at +0x80 (0x6c0228, 0x6c022f; a national side is a club row with half its
 *   nation's reputation)
 * - half time F+0x45/+0x46 at minute 45 (0x6bfe40, 0x6bfe4f), full time F+0x43/+0x44 at 90 (0x6bfe6d,
 *   0x6bfe7c), the side goals at engine +0xf5bd and +0xf5f3 (0x6bfe67, 0x6bfe76), the minute word +0x8ed0
 *   (0x6bfe01)
 * - level at 90 (one leg: F+0x43 == F+0x44 at 0x6bfed0; two legs, F+0x4b not -1: the aggregates with the first
 *   leg F+0x4b/+0x4c at 0x6bfe96..0x6bfea9): flags F+0x38 0x80 or 0x02 play extra time (0x6bfeb1..0x6bfec5).
 *   Else two legs with flag 4 clear and away goals F+0x44 != F+0x4b decide, unless flag 0x4000 (0x6c001c..
 *   0x6c0049); else flag 0x01 or 0x20 gives penalties (0x6c004f, 0x6c0060)
 * - after 120 the totals go to F+0x47/+0x48 (0x6c0085); still level (one leg 0x6c0102; two legs the aggregate,
 *   and with 0x4000 also F+0x48 == F+0x4b, 0x6c00a5..0x6c00ec): flag 0x01 or 0x20 gives penalties
 * - penalties F+0x49/+0x4a, never equal (0x6c0116..0x6c018f); then two legs add the result to F+0x4b/+0x4c
 *   (0x6c0192..0x6c01c9)
 * A draw with no flag stays a draw: the cup plans its replay (Cup::decide_tie_winner 0x51f2f0). The man of the
 * match 0x6d0f80, the reputation update 0x6d1cc0 and the result apply 0x6b5f00 (table, cup tie, gate money,
 * records, FIFA ranking) run as before. The goals come from a random number of the host, not utils_random
 * 0x90cfc0, so the instant result itself takes no draw of the game. */
