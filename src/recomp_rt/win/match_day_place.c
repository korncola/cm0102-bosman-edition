/* A weather postponement keeps the match day's place in its fixture list (0.6.2 item 84, tools/recomp/match_day.py).
 *
 * MATCH_DAY::MATCH_DAY 0x6b3c10 collects the matches of one date and slice. For each competition group it takes the
 * fixture list of that day and slice from the fixture store (0x5ae6a0 calls 0x5abf10, which returns the store's own
 * LLIST, store[day * 3 + slice][group], 0x5abfd7..0x5abfda) and walks it with the list's cursor: head +2 into the
 * cursor +0xa at 0x6b3ce3..0x6b3ce8, then LLIST::get_next 0x68d1b0 (it returns the node's fixture and moves the cursor
 * to node +6) at 0x6b3ced and 0x6b3e85. A match whose weather check 0x923630 (0x6b3d20) says postponed is copied, the
 * original marked -2 (0x6b3d43), its copy given a new date by find_new_fixture_date 0x5ab510 (0x6b3d5f) and added
 * with add_fixture 0x5aa680 (0x6b3d71). Both look for clashes with find_fixture_clashes 0x5ad780, whose day scan
 * 0x5adba0 takes the store's list of each day it checks from 0x5abf10 (0x5ade53) and walks it with the same cursor
 * (0x5ade64..0x5ade6c); a scan that reaches the end leaves it at 0, and one that stops early leaves it part way. When
 * it checks the postponed match's own day and slice, the cursor of the list that MATCH_DAY walks moves, so the next
 * call of 0x68d1b0 returns 0 (or a later match) and the rest of the list is never played.
 * Nothing plays a past fixture again, so a league with such a match never completes (League::check_complete 0x689ad0:
 * every row has played (clubs - 1) x rounds) and never starts its next season. In the Tier A game a2021s1 the
 * weather postponed SC Kufu-98 v SJK on 18 October 2046 (day 291), the next match of that list, HJK v JIPPO, was
 * skipped, and the Veikkausliiga and Ykkösliiga (one league table entry) held edition 2046 for ever (item 84). Of
 * 107 postponements of 2041 to 2046 in that game, one lost the place.
 *
 * Here the place of the list is kept before the copy (0x6b3d2d) and set back after its add (0x6b3d76), when the
 * kept node is still in the list. The cursor goes in the date search: 0x5ab510 checks its candidate days with
 * find_fixture_clashes from two days before to two days after (0x5adba0 per day), and a candidate is today + 2 or
 * later (0x5ab930), so the match's own day is among the days it scans. add_fixture's moves remove fixtures only of the
 * days it checks around the new date (0x5abc30 at 0x5aa9e0 and 0x5aaa15), from today + 1 on, never today's. The walk
 * from the head still checks the node before it is set back. When the place did not change, nothing is written: the
 * game is the original's. The test switch RECOMP_MATCH_DAY_PLACE=off keeps the original's place. */
