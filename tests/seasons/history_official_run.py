"""Competition history of the official data sets in later start years (0.6.2 open item 149).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/history_official_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> <folder of databases>
        [--only <run>,...] [--jobs n]

The official data sets (3.9.60, 3.9.65, 3.9.68) hold the history of 2001 in every start year. Before the fix, a
new game of such data in 2003 or later held no row of the label years 2002 to the start (no World Cup 2002, no
Euro 2004, no OFC Nations Cup 2002 or 2004). The fill now writes the researched rows of
docs/research/history-0.6.0/plan-official.tsv that hold for the start year. Each run is a new game (England, seed
1) to the first news screen with the test log RECOMP_HISTORY_LOG (season_history.c). The runs:
    3.9.68-2003, 3.9.68-2004, 3.9.68-2010  the game's own 3.9.68 data
    3.9.65-2004, 3.9.60-2004                the official versions from the folder of databases
    Summer 2004                             a season database in its own season (plan.tsv): the rows it had
The checks, at the database load and at the first turn (the game then keeps the rows of the selected nations,
0x539ae0, so only the competitions it kept are checked there):
    plan    for each competition below, every label year from 2001 to the start year that the plan of that
            database fills for this start year holds exactly the planned first and second, and no other row.
    real    the winners of FACTS (public records, independent of the research table) for each edition that ended
            before the start: Euro 2004 Greece and the OFC Nations Cups of 2002 and 2004 in a 2004 game, and so on.
At most --jobs (2) games run at the same time.
