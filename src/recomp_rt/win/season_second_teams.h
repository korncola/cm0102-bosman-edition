/* Second teams: shared code of the nation rules (open items 111 and 114 to 122; season_second_teams.c).
 *
 * Each nation's file (season_<nation>_second.c) keeps its own rule. The wraps that more than one nation needs live
 * in season_second_teams.c only, because a function of the original takes one wrap:
 *   - League::update_positions_and_status 0x684cd0 (vtable +0x94): the hooks before_status run before it,
 *   - the promotion chain 0x689c20 (vtable +0xb0): the hooks before_chain run before it and after_chain after it,
 *   - the club moves of a new game (season_clubs.c) ask season_second_barred, which asks each nation.
 * A nation adds its hooks with SEASON_SECOND_HOOKS(name) in its own file, so no nation edits this file or
 * season_second_teams.c.
 * Each hook gets the league object (the this of the call) and acts only on its own leagues. */
