/* The OFC Nations Cup of 8 teams (0.6.2 open item 45). The finals table (season_intl_table.c) gives 8 teams in
 * 2002 (int-continental-21), 2012 (-120), 2016 (-164) and 2024 (-252), and after the table every edition takes the
 * 8 of the last row (0.6.2 decision A). Each of these editions has two groups of 4, the top two of each group to
 * the semi-finals, then the final. The base game (season_intl_on() 0) and every edition of another count (6 in
 * 2004, 4 in 2008) take the original's path: each site and wrap here gives the original's value or calls the
 * original then.
 *
 * The class OceaniaNations (oceania_nations.cpp, ctor 0x7988b0, vtable 0x96e0cc) plays 6 nations. The League
 * object is group A, stage[0] (+0xc, count +0x2c = 2 at 0x798980) is group B and stage[1] the Cup_Stage of the
 * semi-finals. On its draw day update_for_date 0x79a100 calls:
 * - select_and_draw_teams 0x799e30: 6 team pointers at +0xee (+0xf2 the count as a word, 6 at 0x799e42; a block of
 *   0x18 at 0x799e4d). Australia and New Zealand (key ids at 0x9cf224 and 0x9cf3f4) go to places 0 and 3 in an
 *   order drawn by utils_random 0x90cfc0 (0x799f92), two Melanesian nations (0x53d900) to places 1 and 4 and two
 *   Polynesian nations (0x53d940) to places 2 and 5, each pair from the top of its list (0x4afbd0 at 0x79a03c and
 *   0x79a04d) in a drawn order (0x79a052, 0x79a096). From 2006 the wrap in season_intl.c (ofc_australia) puts the
 *   Oceania nation with the highest reputation in Australia's place;
 * - set_predicted_positions 0x79a320 (vtable +0x5c, 0x79a1df): 6 places 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5 (0x79a425..0x79a46b);
 * - create_group_table 0x7995a0: a table of 3 rows (+0x3e = 3 at 0x7995ae, 0xb1 bytes at 0x7995a9) with the teams
 *   0, 1 and 2 (League::init_table_row 0x687430 at 0x799659);
 * - create_group_stage 0x799a60 (0x79a2c7, group 0): a League_Stage (0x68b100 at 0x799b79) of 3 teams (0x799b74),
 *   the teams 3, 4 and 5 copied to a block of 0xc (0x799a80, the copy at 0x799ac2..0x799ae3).
 * Then +0xee is freed and +0xf2 cleared (0x79a2d3..0x79a2e1), so the draw and the groups are made on one day and a
 * save holds only the tables: the League save and load keep the row count +0x3e (0x689461, 0x688379). The group
 * template create_schedule 0x798b60 has 3 match days (0x798bc8), as the Asian Cup's groups of 4 (0x40eb00); the
 * League scheduler makes rows / 2 fixtures a day (0x6838d6..0x6838e5). Each day of the OFC template has one
 * kick-off slot (slot 0, 0x798ca2..0x798d0a; slot 1 ends the list, 0x798c33), the Asian Cup's two (0x40ec3e,
 * 0x40ec4f; slot 2 ends it, 0x40ebb5). The knockout create_knockout_stage 0x799c50 takes rows 0 and 1 of each
 * group (League table row 0x6826d0 at 0x799cb7..0x799ce6), so it is the same for groups of 4. The rule bytes of
 * set_up_rules 0x799690 (+0x43, +0xc2..+0xc7, +0x4a) are those of the Asian Cup's groups of 4 (0x40f4c0).
 *
 * With 8 teams: the draw adds two Oceania nations by the real split of direct and qualifying places (split_draw
 * below, 0.7.0 option b), one to the end of each group (places 3 and 7; the six move to 0 to 2 and 4 to 6). The
 * groups have 4 rows; the predicted places are 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7; a group's fourth gets the group stage codes
 * of a third (set_club_progress 0x79a490); on the draw day each group day gets a second kick-off slot, a copy of its
 * first, so that both matches of the day play at the same time. Sites in tools/recomp/seasons.py ("OFC Nations Cup
 * of 8 teams"). The places of the two added nations in the groups are a decision of this build: inference, not a
 * source.
 *
 * The edition of 4 teams (2008, int-continental-87; https://www.rsssf.org/tables/08oc.html, read 3 November 2026): New
 * Zealand, New Caledonia, Fiji and Vanuatu in one group, home and away, no knockout, 12 matches on 8 days from 17
 * October 2007 to 19 November 2008. The game plays it so (with changing rules off, in every edition when the start
 * season's edition is this one, Q232):
 * - set_up_rules 0x799690 (the constructor 0x798994 and start_new_season 0x799951 call it; a load does not, 0x798961):
 *   each pair meets twice (+0x3c, 1 at 0x7996d2; the League scheduler makes rows - 1 rounds that many times,
 *   0x683ac9..0x683ad3), and the stage count +0x2c (2 at 0x798980) becomes 0, so League::update_for_date 0x6847c0
 *   never calls advance_stage 0x7999d0 (it calls it while +0x30 < +0x2c - 1, 0x6849d1..0x6849e0) and ends the
 *   edition when the group's table is complete: the club history 0x442e80 (0x6849fa), the honours (vtable +0x30,
 *   0x684a8f) and the complete flag +0x4c (0x684a9e). The draw date (+0xb6 day, +0xb8 year offset; 5 March of the
 *   edition year at 0x7996b3..0x799739) becomes 1 October 2007, after the South Pacific Games of 2007 that chose the
 *   three other teams (inference: the sources give no draw). The next set_up_rules gives +0x2c its 2 again, with a
 *   new stage array (a load of a save of the edition of 4 makes the array of the saved count, none for 0:
 *   0x688e44..0x688e5b);
 * - the group template (create_schedule 0x798b60, stage -1, kept at +0xba): 6 match days in place of 3 (0x798bc8),
 *   so the League scheduler makes a double round robin of 2 fixtures a day. The days are the real days of the
 *   edition with two matches, or one match on each of two near days: 17 and 21 November 2007, 14 and 21 June, 6 and
 *   10 September 2008; for a game made after them (a 2008/09 start, made on 1 January 2008) the first 6 of these and
 *   15 October and 19 November 2008 that come at least a week after the game's day (15 October: an international
 *   match day of 2008, inference; 19 November: the real last match day). With fewer than 6 such days the original's
 *   template of 3 days stays and each pair meets once. The friendly days of the finals (season_intl_finals_busy)
 *   still cover the original's 19 June window only (finals_days, season_intl_rules.c): a friendly that clashes with
 *   a group day is moved by add_fixture 0x5aa680 as any clash;
 * - the draw: New Zealand (key id 0x9cf3f4, one of the original's six) and the three Oceania nations with the
 *   highest nation reputation (the real three came from the South Pacific Games, which the game does not play:
 *   inference); +0xf2 is 4, so create_group_table makes 4 rows, and the wrap of create_group_stage 0x799a60 (group
 *   B; the original calls it at 0x79a2c7) skips it; the predicted places are 1 to 4; the progress codes of the group
 *   (set_club_progress 0x79a490) are the places, as the original passes on the codes of its knockout stage
 *   (0x79a515..0x79a52b), not the codes of a group that goes on to a knockout (inference);
 * - the honours: slot +0x30 of the class is 0x595160, a jump to stage 1's (the knockout's Cup::record_season_honours
 *   0x519a90). With no stage the class takes League::record_season_honours 0x684640: the group's first is the winner,
 *   the second the runner-up (rows 0 and 1 of +0xb1, 0x68465b..0x68465d). */

/* ---- The direct and qualifying places of an edition of 8 (0.7.0, open item 45 option b; Max, 3 November 2026) ----
 *
 * The real editions of 8 took the best-ranked Oceania nations straight to the finals and gave the last places to a
 * qualifying round of the lowest-ranked (run-logs/0.6.2-s45b/research-ofc.md):
 * - 2002 (https://www.rsssf.org/tables/02oc.html): 6 straight, the top six of the FIFA ranking of October 2001
 *   (Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tahiti, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu), and 2 from the round of the nations ranked 7
 *   to 12 (Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia);
 * - 2012, 2016 and 2024 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_OFC_Nations_Cup_qualification, ..._2016_OFC_Nations_Cup,
 *   ..._2024_OFC_Men's_Nations_Cup_qualification): 7 straight with the hosts, 1 from the round of the four lowest.
 * After the table each edition takes the split of the last row (2024, split_of); with changing rules off the split
 * of the start season's edition stays (Q232). Max chose (option b) that the game plays no round: the qualifying
 * places go to the strongest of the next nations of the ranking.
 *
 * The ranking is the game's own FIFA ranking: the FIFA_RANKINGS object (its pointer at [0xb74318] +0x1c, read at
 * 0x49c248..0x49c253 by the rankings screen) has at +0 its table, a record of 0x2c bytes for each nation id, +0x10
 * its position from 1
 * (create_default_table 0x58dd50 seeds the score from nation +0xa8, the ranking points of the data, and numbers the
 * positions by score at 0x58de5f..0x58de7d; update_rankings 0x58d460 numbers them again each month;
 * get_nation_strength_tier 0x58e190 reads +0x10 at 0x58e1ae). A nation with no position comes after those with one,
 * then the nation reputation and the nation id decide. The hosts of the edition (the table's, after the table the
 * rotation's) go straight; the next 8 - places - hosts Oceania nations with a national team go straight too; the
 * next `places` take the qualifying places.
 *
 * The draw keeps the original's draw of six (0x799e30: the group heads and the Melanesian and Polynesian places):
 * a team of the six that does not go straight gives its place to the best-ranked nation that goes straight and is
 * not in yet. The added places 3 and 7 take the qualifying places (2002), or the last nation that goes straight and
 * the qualifying place (2012 on), as season_intl_ofc_draw places them. */
