"""Tier A against the normal game (0.6.2 slice 3, decision Q10): two saves of the same start, database and seed, one
from a Tier A run (RECOMP_TIER_A=1) and one from the normal game, each near the same July. They count as the same
when they agree on editions, dates, hosts and entrant rules. Winners can differ.

Usage:
    python3 -I tests/seasons/future/tier_a_compare.py <normal.sav> <tier_a.sav> [--out <file>]

The two runs save on days a little apart, and each save keeps the old fixtures of a competition for a while. So
the fixtures are compared in a window that both saves hold: per competition, from the later of the two first
fixture days to the earlier save day. The checks, from the history checker (history_check.py) of each save:
    editions    the history rows (competition, year) from the start year on, the editions in the window
                (history_check.editions_of), and the edition that each finals class waits for
    dates       the match days of both saves in the window split into parts at each gap of more than PART_GAP
                days (a season, or a half before a long winter break). Each part has matches in both saves,
                its first day in the two saves is within FIRST_DAYS days, and its last day within LAST_DAYS (when
                the part ends more than LAST_DAYS days before the window ends)
    hosts       the host of each history row from the start year on
    entrants    the entrant faults of the checker (entrant-confed, -count, -host, -route, -holder, -dead: the
                year's access rule)
Each difference is one line "DIFF <check> <competition> <year>: normal ... / Tier A ...". The exit code is 1 when
any check differs, or when a save gives no edition or the two saves have other start years.

Results move some days, some edition years and some entrants, as they move the winners. These are NOTE lines
and do not fail:
    - a part with one match in one save only, and match days in one save only: replays of drawn ties, matches moved for a cup or European tie, the
      Saturday or Sunday of a match
    - an edition whose year is one year off in the other save, when its last match moves across 31 December
    - the number of teams in the window (which champions start in an earlier qualifying round follows the club
      coefficients), and the count of entrants per nation (a title holder's nation follows the winner)
    - friendlies, reserve and under-21 matches, which clubs and nations arrange in play
Compare the saves of every July of the two runs, not only the last, so that a difference that clears again is
still found.
