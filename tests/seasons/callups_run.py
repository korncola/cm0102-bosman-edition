"""Senior call-ups of players at clubs on another continent (open item 143; tools/recomp/original_faults.py, group
callups).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/callups_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> --keep <folder> [--days 66] [--keep-faults]

The run loads allleagues.sav of the test fixtures (every league, Arsenal, 14.7.01; tests/fixtures/fixtures.py make
--all), goes on holiday with no setting (the clicks of tests/seasons/holiday_offers_run.py) and saves --days game
days later. RECOMP_SQUAD_LOG=1 logs each senior pick of NationalTeams::select_squad 0x76c120: the nation, the record
(friendly or other), the squad slots set after the pick, the nation's players with a club, those at a club on another
continent and those of them that the original's release rule refuses (src/recomp_rt/win/squad_log.c). The picks for
the friendlies of 30.9.01 come on 15.9.01 (day 258), so 66 days hold them. The checks:
    - the senior picks of Mali, Senegal, Guinea, Cape Verde Islands and Guinea-Bissau came. The original's rule
      refuses most of their players (Mali 35 of 38, Senegal 85 of 103), and their squads held 1, 7, 4, 1 and 1
      players (on the fix 12, 26, 24, 17 and 14)
    - each of them picked at least MIN_SQUAD (11, a side that can play with no virtual player), and so did every
      senior pick of a nation with 26 or more players with a club
The pick keeps its other gates. With the fix, Mali's 26 players with a club that it does not pick are 12 regular
players of clubs with a competitive match on the friendly's date (the club table of
NationalTeams::mark_clubs_with_fixtures 0x7775c0 and the playing-time mood, contract +0x3d, over -10: 0x76cd44..
0x76cd73), 7 in its under-21 squad, 6 injured and 1 more (RECOMP_SQUAD_LOG_NATION=Mali logs the gate of each).
    - no message box (RECOMP_SCREEN_LOG=1: "recomp: message box from"), and the run ends with code 0
--keep-faults runs with RECOMP_ORIGINAL_FAULTS=keep:callups (the original's rule) and passes only when the squad
checks fail: the proof that they find the fault. The run takes about 20 minutes.
