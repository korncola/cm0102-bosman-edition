/* Finland: second teams stay out of the Veikkausliiga and play below their first team (open item 118, 0.7.0).
 *
 * The real rule. Palloliitto, Jalkapallon kilpailumääräykset 2024 and 2026, § 6.12 (last sentence): the reserve
 * team (or a farm or partner club) of a club in the top tier may not go up into the top tier, nor play the separate
 * promotion play-off to it. § 3.24 (2024), § 3.25 (2026) and § 3.23 (2023): a reserve team plays in a lower tier
 * than its club's first team. Sources read on 3 November 2026: the 2023, 2024 and 2026 texts at
 * www-assets.palloliitto.fi (research notes of open item 111, FIN.md). No text before 2023 was found, so the build
 * applies the same rule in every season (Max, 3 November 2026: "do whatever real life does"; the gap is recorded
 * under item 118). The texts do not say which club takes a barred team's place. Max decided on 3 November 2026: the
 * next club in the table.
 *
 * The original. The game plays the Premier Division (Veikkausliiga, key [0x9cf7e8], FinPrm) and the First Division
 * (FinFirst, key [0x9cf7f8]), which has two groups: its own table (North) and the League_Stage of stage 0 (South,
 * FinFirst +0xc [0]). The four Second Division groups (keys 0x9cf7fc North, 0x9cf800, 0x9cf804, 0x9cf808) only hold
 * clubs. After the groups FinFirst::advance_stage 0x593f90 calls FinFirst::create_play_off_stages 0x594080
 * (at 0x594067). It builds:
 * - stage 1, the promotion play-off: rows 0 and 1 of each group (0x594295..0x5942ce: North 1st, South 2nd,
 *   North 2nd, South 1st). Its winner gets status 5 (FinFirst::update_staff_records_for_status 0x594810, stage 1
 *   code 1, 0x5948a3) and goes up. Its other finalist (status 2 in the stage's list, +0xa7 rows of 6 bytes, +5)
 *   plays stage 3;
 * - the clubs of the Second Division: it lists the Finnish clubs of the four groups (0x5940c4..0x59410d, at most 50),
 *   sorts them by reputation and shuffles the top 18 (0x4afbd0 at 0x594158), keeps 4 at +0xee (0x594179..0x59424a,
 *   two on each side of a latitude test) that go up at the season change, and 2 more for stage 2, the relegation
 *   play-off against the 8th of each group (0x5943c2..0x594483).
 * When the Premier Division is complete, advance_stage calls FinFirst::create_premier_play_off_stage 0x594610 (at
 * 0x594058): stage 3 is the stage-1 finalist (status 2 in stage 1's list, 0x59468c) against the Premier Division's
 * club of status 2 (0x5946c4). A First Division club that wins it gets status 0 (0x5949e5).
 * At the season change FinPrm::start_new_season 0x595d40 calls the chain FinPrm::process_promotion_relegation_chain
 * 0x596110 (vtable +0xb0, at 0x595d52). It calls league_promote_and_relegate 0x689c80 in pairs for the Premier
 * Division and the North table (0x59617d), then the South table (0x5961aa): each Premier row of status 3 goes down
 * with the first row of status 0 or 5 of the group (0x689d1a..0x689e07). Then FinPrm::refresh_first_division_clubs
 * 0x595f00 (at 0x595d5a) moves the Second Division winners of stage 2 and the 4 clubs of +0xee into the First
 * Division (0x6830b0 at 0x595f48, 0x59600e) and sends the rows of status 3 of both groups to Second Division North
 * (0x6831a0 at 0x595fb4). No step tests a second team, and club_get_linked_b_team 0x540a50 has no Finnish pair.
 *
 * The fix (season games only, season_game_changes, as the other season code):
 * - Stage 1 (wrap of 0x594080): a second team takes no part. For the call the clubs of rows 0 and 1 of each group
 *   are the two best placed clubs that are not second teams (only the club field of the rows changes, and only
 *   during the call), so the next club in the table plays.
 * - The Second Division picks (the same wrap): a second team whose first team does not play in the Premier Division
 *   is no part of the list (its division reads as none during the call, as Norway's 0x792960), so the next club of
 *   the list takes the place. A second team of a Premier Division club may go up into the First Division (HJK's
 *   Klubi 04 played the Ykkönen and the Ykkösliiga).
 * - Stage 3 (wrap of 0x594610): when the stage-1 finalist is a second team (a save of an older build), the best
 *   placed club of its group that is not a second team and not in stage 1 plays in its place.
 * - The season change (wrap of 0x596110, before the chain): a second team with an up status in a group (an older
 *   save) hands it to the next club of the table; a second team in the Premier Division (an older save) gets status
 *   3 in exchange for a club of status 3 that stays up (the chain moves in pairs); a second team of the First
 *   Division whose first team will not play in the Premier Division next season gets status 3, and the best placed
 *   club of status 3 of its group stays up.
 * - After refresh_first_division_clubs (wrap of 0x595f00): a second team now in the First Division whose first team
 *   is not in the Premier Division goes to Second Division North (League::relegate_club_to_division 0x6831a0, as
 *   0x595fb4). Each place left over goes to the club of the Second Division groups with the highest reputation that
 *   may play there and did not just come down (League::move_club_to_division 0x6830b0, as 0x59600e).
 * - The club moves of a new game (season_clubs.c) put no Finnish second team into the Premier Division. A second
 *   team that a new game leaves in the First Division above or beside its first team goes down at the first season
 *   change, as in an older save (the fill does not know yet where the first team ends; no test database has such a
 *   case).
 *
 * The link. No club field names a club's first team. A second team is a name of season_clubs_reserve_name (a last
 * word II, 2, B or Reserves), a last word III or 3, or a name of the table below; its first team is the Finnish
 * club named by the name without that last word, or by the table. No fuzzy match is made. Not in the table:
 * Atlantis Akatemia and KPV juniorit, the first teams of Atlantis FC and KPV in the old data (rules research
 * nor-fin.md); FC Jazz-juniorit, the youth club of FC Jazz that took the name FC Jazz in 2010 (en.wikipedia.org/
 * wiki/FC_Jazz; FC Jazz-juniorit ry runs the first team, fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Jazz); Oulun Palloseura Juniorit
 * and the Kerho 07 of the 2017 to 2021 data, for which no source says whether they are a reserve or a farm club
 * (open item 118). A second team with no first team found keeps only the bar from the Premier Division and its
 * play-off. In the 50 test databases every linked second team of the First and Second Divisions finds its first
 * team. The entries for SJK Seinäjoki II and III are needed
 * where the data names the first team Seinäjoen Jalkapallokerho.
 *
 * Test switches (tests/seasons/fin_second_run.py): RECOMP_FIN_SECOND=off plays as the original; RECOMP_FIN_SECOND_LOG
 * =1 writes what the code does and a census at each season change; RECOMP_TEST_FIN_SECOND_TOP=1 puts each second team
 * of the First Division at the top of its group before 0x594080 (as if it won the group; the rows move for good, also
 * with RECOMP_FIN_SECOND=off); RECOMP_TEST_FIN_SECOND_OLD
 * =<n> plays as the original until n Finnish season changes are done, and with RECOMP_TEST_FIN_SECOND_TOP=1 gives
 * stage 1's place to a second team in those changes (status 5), so the original sends it up into the Premier Division
 * (an older save, made in memory); RECOMP_TEST_FIN_SECOND_DROP=1 sends the first team of each second team of the
 * First Division down at the season change (it gets status 3, and the club of status 3 with the best place stays
 * up), so the second team must go down too; RECOMP_TEST_FIN_SECOND_LATE=1 plays a save of an older build made after
 * the play-off: a second team is the stage-1 finalist when stage 3 is built and holds stage 1's place (status 5) at
 * the season change; RECOMP_TEST_FIN_SECOND_REP=1 gives each second team of the Second Division groups the highest
 * reputation before 0x594080, so the original would pick it. The test switches act in season games whether the fix is
 * on or off, so a run with RECOMP_FIN_SECOND=off shows the fault. */
