"""France: a reserve side does not go up from the CFA into the National (open item 116, 0.7.0; season_fra_second.c).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/fra_second_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--only on,off] [--jobs n] [--keep <folder>]
        [--last <year>]

Each run is a season jump of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py with France alone on the November 2020 database
(changing rules off, 12 reserve sides in the CFA), from the 2020 start to the end of the season that starts in
--last (default 2021, to 1 June 2022), so the game plays the French season change (FraFirst::start_new_season 0x5bc4d0, which calls
FraFirst::exchange_cfa_national_clubs 0x5bc780). The 12 reserve sides of the database's French CFA keep the CFA
zone in A Lower Division, so they are in the list. The test switch RECOMP_TEST_FRA_SECOND_REP=1 gives each listed
French reserve side the highest reputation, so the original would send four of them up.
RECOMP_FRA_SECOND_LOG=1 logs the reserve sides held back and the clubs that go up. The runs:
    on    the shipped code: no reserve side goes up, four other clubs go up, and reserve sides stay in the CFA
    off   RECOMP_FRA_SECOND=off, the original's list: reserve sides go up (proves that the test sees the fault)
    old1  the state of an old save, made in memory (no save is written or loaded): RECOMP_TEST_FRA_SECOND_OLD=1
          plays as the original until the season change of 2021 is done, so reserve sides go up into the National,
          and RECOMP_TEST_FRA_SECOND_NO_MARK=1 lets the 2021/22 table give them places as the original (as a save
          made after the table was complete). To 1 June 2023: at the change of 2022 every reserve side leaves the
          National, the three divisions keep their sizes, and no reserve side goes up
    old2  the same with the marks: the 2021/22 season plays with the fix, so no reserve side holds a place
All runs end with code 0 and show no message box of the game.
